No one wants these public health restrictions. They only were brought back only because unvaccinated assholes were overloading our hospital system during the Omicron wave. Now that the Omicron wave is over, the restrictions are being lifted. Also, each province has its own rules on Covid restrictions.

I'm not worried about protecting myself given that statistically, I'm at little risk. Also, I've not convinced I'm protecting others to the extent govnment may say I am. Or overwhelming the health system as my wife is a nurse and often sits idle on her shifts. Moreso, I'm not incentivized to get a 3rd dose anytime soon.

22,fight-like-a-girl,2022-03-11,"My understanding is that the WHO recommended against booster programs because of vaccine inequity. Many countries don't have adequate access to vaccines and it's in everyone's best interests to provide vaccination to those who really need it. The WHO didn't say boosters are bad for you, just that as a global community we need to share the supply with those who need it most. I got my booster because as far as I understand, those doses that are in the local pharmacy will either be used or wasted.

I was back and forth with one dude/ette that got all butthurt when I said that it wasn't a problem for me because I got vaxxed. So then I was the completely selfish ""I got mine"" person. I said no - we both made choices with their accompanying consequences. I feared getting covid again because of my health - didn't think I'd get lucky twice and I want to travel because I have a daughter far away. If I end up growing a tail because of the vax, I guess I have to live with that, and I will. They chose not to get vaxxed - maybe that will be smarter if we do all end up growing tails but the consequence of that is that they can't fly right now but will probably get to one day.

But my uncle, her husband may not be vaccinated either. On top of that is all the people that they were either influenced by or have influenced into not getting it. It's crazy because my oldest aunt has had a liver transplant, is overweight and has diabetes. I couldn't imagine feeling comfortable being in her bubble.

I know someone here who wants to get vaccinated but has overstayed her visa and is scared to interact with any institution. I know someone else who is lazy as f*** and has no car and would probably get a shot if someone showed up at his door with one.

I understand that the risk they present to me is only modestly higher than another vaccinated person might present. But if they haven't done the one simple thing they could have done to help end this interaction be normal, then I'd just rather not have it at all.

We shut down our store for ten days when we had one positive case even though every other employee tested negative. For you to say I’m putting anyone at risk is absurd. We don’t come within six feet of any customer, and every single employee of mine is double vaccinated. Please tell me why we need to wear masks still? If you’re going to say to protect those who can’t get the vaccine, well for one, we’re located in a bar, so there are no children coming into the store. 2, when I’m in public, I’m never near any children. Nor do I go near enough anyone to put my droplets into their mouth. 3, there are inherent risks to life. If those risks are too much for you, then you should stay home with your mask on. I’d rather live my life in the short time we have on earth. Furthermore, these cloth masks that everyone wears are completely nonsensical. It even says on the box, not meant to provide protection from viruses. The particle size of the virus is much smaller than the holes in the cloth mask. Nothing I said I’m my comments was anti science. In fact, you pushing for masks so hard makes me think you might be the one whose anti-vax? If the vaccine was the solution, you wouldn’t feel the need to wear a mask? I’m fully vaccinated, so I don’t feel the need to cover my face. I’m just trying to get back to the world we once knew. If you want to wear your mask forever, that’s fine. I would never say judge or say anything negative to someone wearing a mask, because it is their choice. Just like they should respect my choice not to wear one. And I’m not even one of those jerks whose going to go into a store and berate people because I don’t want to wear a mask. Now that they’re mandatory, I’m wearing mine in stores again, and I’m always respectful to people’s personal space. So thank you for your time, but I will not be looking on the Reddit page.

I got vaccinated in hopes of a return to normalcy. I got vaccinated to reduce the threat of contracting and spreading the virus. And I also got vaccinated so that I would never have to wear a mask again. I’ve done my part since the beginning, to the best of my ability. We shut down our store for ten days when we had one positive case even though every other employee tested negative. For you to say I’m putting anyone at risk is absurd. We don’t come within six feet of any customer, and every single employee of mine is double vaccinated. Please tell me why we need to wear masks still? If you’re going to say to protect those who can’t get the vaccine, well for one, we’re located in a bar, so there are no children coming into the store. 2, when I’m in public, I’m never near any children. Nor do I go near enough anyone to put my droplets into their mouth. 3, there are inherent risks to life. If those risks are too much for you, then you should stay home with your mask on. I’d rather live my life in the short time we have on earth. Furthermore, these cloth masks that everyone wears are completely nonsensical. It even says on the box, not meant to provide protection from viruses. The particle size of the virus is much smaller than the holes in the cloth mask. Nothing I said I’m my comments was anti science. In fact, you pushing for masks so hard makes me think you might be the one whose anti-vax? If the vaccine was the solution, you wouldn’t feel the need to wear a mask? I’m fully vaccinated, so I don’t feel the need to cover my face. I’m just trying to get back to the world we once knew. If you want to wear your mask forever, that’s fine. I would never say judge or say anything negative to someone wearing a mask, because it is their choice. Just like they should respect my choice not to wear one. And I’m not even one of those jerks whose going to go into a store and berate people because I don’t want to wear a mask. Now that they’re mandatory, I’m wearing mine in stores again, and I’m always respectful to people’s personal space. So thank you for your time, but I will not be looking on the Reddit page. I’m sure it’s just a toxic place where people bash others to fill the void that’s missing in their own life. I know who my real supporters are, and if you choose to go your own way then that’s fine.

Private businesses do not have unlimited capacity to discriminate, as we know, for example in the case of protected classes. To let every private business, if they so wished, exclude a group of people on the basis of medical procedures, is indeed an exception to our normal understanding of things—it may be a necessary one, or it may be right to allow it, but to say it’s just freedom of choice as we’ve normally understood it, is, I think, to obfuscate the problem. Mandating what people do with respect to their own health care decisions in order to earn access to a broad range of features of ordinary life is a new problem, or at least a new problem insofar as the scale of it has come to encompass the whole society. Out of curiosity, if an organization made it a rule that it would fire anyone who had had an abortion, would you find that a legitimate exercise of freedom? What if they had to show medical records that proved they’d never undergone it? I don’t even necessarily disagree with the vaccine mandates; at least I got vaccinated because I saw no good reason not to, and my motives were a mixture of a desire for my own safety, convenience, and the public good. But repeating the empty slogan ‘freedom of choice is not freedom from consequences’ ad nauseam sheds no light on ‘freedom of choice’ as a political concept. In my view, the proper way to go about talking about this is to own the fact that ‘freedom of choice’ is a socially mediated right, is subject to notions of a common good, and that there is a permissible range of situations where it can be suspended or modified.

Kind of like SARS in 2003 but much, much, much, more mutable. It isn’t that 2003 SARS, SARS-COVID-2 was is a new mutation, but for some inexplicable reason, far too many people do not understand the original virus was novel, never mind the virus’s ability to mutate so quickly. So unlike what is what we now call he “flu” and 2003 SARS which, fortunately (unlike today) mutated out of humans. Now SARS-COVID-2 has even more virulent variants. This is not going away. The only things we can do is get vaccinated, get boosters, and push those who won’t get vaccinated to grow a spine. I’m tired of hearing about vaccine hesitant folk’s tender feelings. What about mine? I did everything that experts advised. Because it made sense. I got vaccinated because, scientifically, due to decades of research it made sense (if you don’t actually read science do look at BioNTech This is a truly virulent strain. Do not pretend otherwise, those who survive it can often not smell or taste, have lung issues that may require transplants, emerge from fighting this “shades” of their former fit selves (a fitness guru in the US lost 70 lbs and is literally a shade of his former self, easy to look up). Others, face long term inability to walk, run, engage in exercise without gasping for air despite being fit before COVID-19, or its variants.

I got vaccinated because I believe the people who are responsible for this are doing their job. I didn't say I want Pfizer or moderna. I took whatever they had that day. They told me it works. I believed them. It did. It worked exceptionally well for Delta, the variant that didn't exist when the vaccines were originally developed. If the vaccination works then why can't life go back to normal. If it's because of the 15% who are unvaccinated then HOW THE HELL IS THAT MY PROBLEM? either force them to get vaccinated or make THEM stay at home. Why do I have to do this. We're not continuing our plan to normalcy right now because we don't know how our healthcare system will look in 2 months after rapid spread of omicron. Our healthcare system is fragile right now. We cannot allow it to collapse. If we need to stay like this to ""stop the spread"" then when the hell does it stop? Why did we even get vaccinated if we have to stay at home. You don't have to stay home, you just can't think anymore that you're completely immune to getting it. You need to understand that this virus doesn't listen to us human, it's acting on its own. We're only reacting to it. Capacities are limited because your current vaccinations aren't enough to prevent infection like with other variants, it's looking like severe infection is still prevented, but not symptomatic infection. Somewhere along the process it doesn't make sense. I am not a high risk group. I should be able to go about my life after two years now. We are at a point now where the groups that are at a higher risk should have specific rules about them, instead of the whole population. Older people should continue to be careful. If you are immunocompromised then maybe you should be careful still. The problem with that line of thinking is that unchecked spread of an already highly contagious virus will lead to more death.

I'm not hateful towards anti-vaxxers (though I do have frustrations), but I also recognize that outside of the very small percentage that are unable to vaccinate due to health concerns, the rest are refusing to vaccinate because they trust YouTubers and Facebook memes over tens of thousands of actual doctors and scientists across the world. Unless you're one of those few with legit health concerns, or some conspiracy nut that thinks the government is trying to inject you with a tracking chip, there's no reason not to get the shot. False concerns like ""it's been rushed"" stem from ignorance and after this much time, if you're still ignorant to these things, it's by choice. Willful ignorance should not be rewarded, especially when it helps perpetuate the existence of a deadly virus. Which brings me to the next point... allowing those who decide to not get a vaccine to attend a outdoor football game. Because attending a sporting event is a privilege, not a right. The WFC has decided that the safety of those in attendance (and by extension, the larger population in general) is more important than catering to the small but loud group of people who still refuse to get vaccinated. Such is the right of any business to deny service/entry, so long as it doesn't violate a Charter right. And no, attending a football game is not a Charter right. Asking for proof of vaccination is not a violation either, as you have the choice to refuse. Society is a two-way street. After a year and half how can you be so clueless to know covid prevention steps have ruined society , the economy jobs and personal choices I'm not ignorant to those things. In Manitoba, we've seen how half-measures lead to prolonged periods of increased COVID numbers. Whether you're talking about individual humans and the tolls on their mental health, or the financial difficulties of businesses to remain open, a lot of that has been made worse by Manitoba's half-assed approach to restrictions. By allowing only vaccinated people into the stadium, the WFC is doing its part to not contribute to the spread of COVID, which I alluded to in my previous reply. and you run along without question because the government is your God.

I now know this is advertisement. I have had vaccines in the past so I do not see myself as Anti-vax but highly hesitant. My research lead me to want the JandJ vaccine but by the time I came to this conclusion I had done a lot more research and learned a lot. I believe in our law system or perhaps better to say I had belief in our law system. Each province has their own laws regarding health care. I know Ontario and B.C. Have consent laws and Dr's have sworn oaths to protect those laws. There is a law definition of what is consent and the elements of consent. The federal mandates made it impossible for someone like me to meet the elements of consent. If I got the vaccine so I could return to work or travel. I did not meet the elements of consent. If I got the vaccine because I wanted its protection I meet the elements of consent. I wasn't sure and still am not sure now but I signed something in good faith saying I would let my employer know my vaccine status. I wasn't sure if I wanted to return to work while I still did not want to lose my job. If I got the vaccine because I wanted its protection but still wanted to stay at home while I sort my life out. I was obligated (or at least that is what I have been told by management) to notify them so I can return to work. So on days I though maybe I should get the vaccine I also thought that I wasn't ready to return to work and how I still felt my charter rights have been violated. If I get the vaccine I will have to notify my employer and return to work. This is why we have consent laws. These deciding decision in my case are not based on medical science. They are based on political pressure and coercion. Hate me because I do not share your views. I'm ok with that. I see it no different as someone hating on a religion you have every right to do so. What I am not ok with is our rights being stomped on by a PM who keeps breaking them.

Unless the shots don't protect us like they told us, then that's another can of worms. The requirement was lifted after the damage was caused.

There are a ton of ways in which we curtail societal harm by acting in the best interests of the whole, this vaccine is just one more example.

If you are not a pregnant woman or an unborn baby you have nothing to worry about from Rubella. However if you happen to be a pregnant woman of an unborn baby you are at severe risk from a Rubella infection and the fetus could contract congenital rubella syndrome. Aside from the heightened probability of miscarriage and stillbirth an infant with congenital rubella syndrome often has vision, hearing, heart, and developmental problems among others. Do I as a male need to be vaccinated for Rubella? From a personal perspective, no.

I work within healthcare, no longer in everyday frontline care but I am in and out of facilities frequently across my province and across Canada -- even throughout the pandemic. I wear a mask, I wash my hands and I distance where possible. Initially I got vaccinated because of my family: 1. To reduce the risk of serious illness or death. 2. To reduce the risk of spread. While you were sick and 'it wasn't bad' that is not always the case, and that was my primary concern. Myocarditis from the mRNA vaccines is widely publicized and sensationalized as a reason **not** to be vaccinated but COVID19 carries a much higher risk of myocarditis. More worrisome is **long COVID**, as my career requires a significant amount of problem solving, concentration and focus; if I develop long COVID, my job will be impacted and my team is already very lean so my business will be impacted. **Financially it would burden my family**. My daughter is at an age that isn't eligible to be vaccinated, and while COVID19 infection in children has been reported to be mild (in most cases) there are reports showing ~1/5th of children develop long COVID -- she is a toddler and rapidly developing, I have no idea what the effects of ~6 months to 1 year of brain suppression has long term but likely will delay her development, or potentially have long term effects mentally. [New research](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2033369) is showing much of the neurodegenerative aspects are potentially both short-term and long-term, which is my greatest concern with COVID19. There is also the burden aspect, where I am not one of the typical cases and potentially have a fatal incident -- while my family is well insured, we have a young daughter who would grow up without a father, a wife without a husband... while a very minor risk I do not see why I would not reduce that risk to as low as possible with a vaccination. Yes vaccinations can lead to adverse events, but the risk of a vaccination is much less than the risk brought by natural COVID19 infection. **Spread** Initially with COVID19 I was vaccinated just after frontline due to my exposure potential. I did so mainly to prevent risk of spread within facilities I was visiting... all across Canada. Early on vaccination provided 85% immunity against spreading the virus, which was crucial as we still then knew of asymptomatic spread -- not having symptoms but spreading was a far scarier scenario for my profession, as I commonly encounter immunocompromised individuals or those who care for them. **With the emergence of Delta this protection against spread dropped significantly, and with Omicron even more so**. With this said, being vaccinated, and boosted, may not prevent you from being able to spread COVID19 **but it certainly reduces how long you are infectious for**. If you are shedding the virus for 5 days, rather than 10 days, it makes a difference on community impact. Now if I was in your scenario, with no shots onboard but also with 'natural immunity', I would still get vaccinated. My reasoning being vaccination + natural immunity is known to be the strongest immunity against COVID19; there have been individuals who have caught COVID 'twice' so to speak, and there will likely be further variants -- I want my immune system to have the latest and greatest dossier on the enemy before going to battle, again.

To be honest the reason I was hesitant wasn't for fear of the vaccines or their medical side effects. The reason I was hesitant was becuase I don't know jack shit about science or medicine so whenever I hear a conclusion regarding those things the only way I can evaluate it is based on the credibility of the source. To pretend as many of us do to understand the science is stupid. I'm smart enough to know that I'm too stupid to make an informed assessment of this pandemic. So it all comes down to trust and trust is the one thing that has been so horribly eroded in this pandemic. I didn't want to get the shot because I didn't trust that the media or the government had my best interests at heart. I didn't trust them because I felt like I was seen as an inferior, a person who must be bludgeoned with fear and shame and hate rather than reasoned with in good faith. Between the propaganda, fear-mongering, and my first real taste of the frightening scope of state power I was afraid of these powerful people. I still am afraid of these powerful people. How can I trust a group who tells me to trust them but lies constantly? How can I trust a group whose first appeal is to my hatred and fear rather than my reason? This is the dilemma of a modern democracy: the majority of the population is too ignorant or stupid (myself included) to make informed judgements about major issues, but how can we be a functioning democracy if the answer is a constant stream of propaganda? If we accept that the average person is so stupid that they need their opinions made for them then why even be a democracy? Why not just restrict voting rights to people who score well on IQ tests and let the smart people decide? “Propaganda is to a democracy what the bludgeon is to a totalitarian state.” -Noam Chomsky Oh btw, right wing PPC voting libertarian here.

A study in July showed no mRNA passed through breast milk but that study had it's limitations. She got vaccinated because of the restaurant and gym mandate, but also because many other businesses were imposing their own. That, on top of social pressure and the reactions she got when she said, ""I didn't get my second dose yet"". (she didn't get the second dose because my IBD flared and we couldn't have both parents out sick at once). So she got it. Since her second vaccine in December we have come within six feet of about a dozen people. That's it. We don't go to shopping malls or restaurants or gyms. We stay home. She also delayed her second dose because she didn't see a benefit in getting it while there was basically no active covid (live in NS). When they were talking about waning immunity and booster shots we were like, ""why get your second shot now, and then have to get a third in a few months when you can just delay your second?"". And then the mandates came. But then I look at the main reason I got my second shot, so I could referee hockey. The first thing to be eliminated during the ""omicron"" wave? Organized sports.
