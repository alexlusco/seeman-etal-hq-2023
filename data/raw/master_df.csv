How many tetanus booster shots have you had in your life?

You got six shots before you became an adult, you got another every ten years or so since.

And I guarantee you that not once, not for even a fraction of a second, did any of your objections to getting a COVID booster even cross your mind. You didn't care who made the shot.

I know theoretically if they got vaccinated in-province there might be a record that can be added to your local PHU's numbers since the forms require an address. But I've been seeing accounts on social media of people who didn't feel out any forms, just signed a consent and got the jab.

travman064,"There's a predicted number of 'ease restriction X, you will get Y more cases regardless of vaccination status.'

Earlier in the pandemic, when people were having an absolute meltdown on this sub over the lockdown, Toronto ICUs were full and they were leapfrogging patients all over the province. Like someone from Barrie would be sent a couple hours north so that someone from Toronto could be sent to their ICU bed. 

There are real consequences to this. Not just to covid patients themselves, but to everyone else whose medical service would be impacted. 

It's not as simple as 'I got the jab, so the pandemic is over and it's time to just remove all restrictions.'

Yeah, it sucks that MLSE has lobbyists and influence on the government to get their capacities eased. But people ITT are acting like actually that's a good thing, and that MLSE has the 'common sense easing' that should be applied elsewhere. 

No, it's really the opposite. The 'common sense easing' is what is being applied to regular businesses, with decisions made by experts who are being rightfully cautious. 

It sucks, but the pandemic isn't over. It isn't about ""Covid zero,"" it's about not having people die in the streets or die in an ambulance bus headed to North Bay because there isn't a hospital bed for them in Toronto.

TaterWatkins,"lol. You sure are angry, which is understandable given the last year and a half. Times have been tough for everyone. I hope you start feeling better soon.

I'm not hateful towards anti-vaxxers (though I do have frustrations), but I also recognize that outside of the very small percentage that are unable to vaccinate due to health concerns, the rest are refusing to vaccinate because they trust YouTubers and Facebook memes over tens of thousands of actual doctors and scientists across the world. Unless you're one of those few with legit health concerns, or some conspiracy nut that thinks the government is trying to inject you with a tracking chip, there's no reason not to get the shot. False concerns like ""it's been rushed"" stem from ignorance and after this much time, if you're still ignorant to these things, it's by choice. Willful ignorance should not be rewarded, especially when it helps perpetuate the existence of a deadly virus.

Which brings me to the next point...

&gt; allowing those who decide to not get a vaccine to attend a outdoor football game.

Because attending a sporting event is a privilege, not a right. The WFC has decided that the safety of those in attendance (and by extension, the larger population in general) is more important than catering to the small but loud group of people who still refuse to get vaccinated. Such is the right of any business to deny service/entry, so long as it doesn't violate a Charter right. And no, attending a football game is not a Charter right. Asking for proof of vaccination is not a violation either, as you have the choice to refuse. Society is a two-way street.

&gt; After a year and half how can you be so clueless to know covid prevention steps have ruined society , the economy jobs and personal choices 

I'm not ignorant to those things. In Manitoba, we've seen how half-measures lead to prolonged periods of increased COVID numbers. Whether you're talking about individual humans and the tolls on their mental health, or the financial difficulties of businesses to remain open, a lot of that has been made worse by Manitoba's half-assed approach to restrictions. By allowing only vaccinated people into the stadium, the WFC is doing its part to not contribute to the spread of COVID, which I alluded to in my previous reply.

&gt; and you run along without question because the government is your God.

This one's super funny because I've railed against our government's handling of COVID since the start. I didn't get the shot and encourage others to get the shot because the government told me to lol. I did it because whether you believe in the science or not, the fact is vaccines work. We have plenty of examples of diseases that have been eradicated thanks to vaccines. I got the shot because I wanted to do my part, and to keep the people around me safe (whether they be family/friends or strangers). By the way, that also includes not only those that can't get vaccinated, but the anti-vaxxers as well. I may think they're dangerous idiots, but I still don't think they deserve a terrible death or a miserable life living with severe complications caused by COVID.",1624802029,h37mshn,t3_o8e3pa,t1_h37g4ek,CFL,t5_2qiwn,NA

CodedLegacy,"Hey this sounds like Me! - I just recently got the shot. So far so good - just shoulder pain where the shot was and not even the whole shoulder - literally just the middle delt where the injection was. 

My life literally consists of online classes straight through spring and I literally walk outside around the parks/sidewalks for an hour or so and just hit the grocery store on occasion in off peak/early hours. I also have a decked out home gym and got all that covered too. I also don't have any vulnerable people and my ""household"" was fully vaccinated.

I genuinely think the govt/people here who keep pushing for the vaxx are underestimating how many young home bodies there are now and the so called ""apathetic"" are just people who are in a cozy spot/ have hit the right efficiencies in life where there is just minimal reason to do so and at minimal risk to others.

I'm starting the seasonal job hunt so now all of a sudden these variants actually mean something from an otherwise isolated/controlled life and delta is no joke once I get back out there potentially dealing with tons of forged passports or general hardline anti vaxxers - hence, I got the shot and that's what informed my decision. 

Not mean spirited redditors who scare away any middle of the road folks from ever participating and I'm grateful I can see internet comments for what they are and put the ego aside -- but some sally 19yo who hates getting one upped ? (and causing her to avoid the shot) doubt it.

davidbrake,"It is really not hard to explain how we had this outbreak - it is almost harder to explain how we avoided having one for so long. The precautions that we have been taking were *mostly* good enough to keep the inevitable travel related cases from spreading very far but because of the way that epidemics work, it only takes one undetected problem and one major slip up for things to explode very quickly, especially with a new variant that spreads more easily. 

not to veer too far towards blame, but I would be surprised to find that whoever the person was who brought this in from off the island was genuinely following all of the isolation requirements to the best of their ability. I can‚Äôt find it in my heart to blame the teenagers and others who then further spread the illness. They might well have been following the rather weak guidance for everyday living and could still have easily spread it (perhaps sitting together in groups without masks in a not very well ventilated venue for an extended period?)

I think it would have been money well spent to pay rotational workers not to leave the island and to ensure that anybody who absolutely had to return from the mainland was well supported logistically and closely monitored to ensure that quarantine was effective. Like you, though, I thought we could keep spinning the roulette wheel until we got the vaccine. After all, the gamble had worked so far.

It has been said repeatedly that health professionals who work directly with patients are the ones who are priority right now. Remember that OP only got the vaccine because they had leftover prepared vaccines - not because they were priority but because it's an easy way to make use of the leftover vaccines from no-shows, since once they've been defrosted and prepared, they have a very limited window of time to use them up. My guess is that if they started offering those leftovers to hospital patients and families, it would quickly lead to a mob of people demanding that if other patients and visitors are getting it, they should get it, too. Then suddenly, the whole prioritization process is meaningless. Again, I am no expert and don't work in a hospital, so these are my own thoughts based on what I've read in the media and heard from other health professionals and my employer.

I had an appointment for the vaccine last weekend and then the hospital went and cancelled the whole clinic, so it's kind of disappointing for me to see hospital admin getting the vaccine before the PSW's and RN's that I work with that are visiting 15 private homes in a day...but that's just the reality of the situation.

&gt; At what point does skepticism meet a limit?

I can only answer this personally, and for me it's when the data avaiable makes sense to me in a way that shows taking action is substantially better than not taking action.

&gt;This is where you're losing me.

Here's my basic position:

* I know the relative risk of catching covid, being hospitalized by covid and dying from covid. Both from personal experience in the last 18 or so months and the data that has been available allows me to reach a number that I can trust represents the risks to my health accurately.
  
* It's the first time mRNA vaccines are being used on this scale. There is no placebo studies that span over two months looking at the rate of adverse effects. All that I could find were the EUA applications which were unblinded and placebo recipients got the vaccine because ethically they couldn't not give it to them. So we really don't have any placebo vs pfizer studies that span more than a couple weeks as far as I know.  

* My unpopular position is that I have seen that people who face adverse events are met by doctors who don't know how to proceed since there isn't an established protocol. The side effects may be treated, but the mechanism of why these side effects happen are unknown. All of these side effects are a result of unintended consequences.

The question for me boils down to the relatively known risks of covid vs relatively unknown risks of mRNA vaccines assuming that covid is a naturally occuring pathogen that the immune system has evolved to deal with. At the end of the day, I've done and continue to do things riskier than dying from covid and just don't feel the need to do anything about it really.",1627839753,h7c3mps,t3_ovi7mi,t1_h7bzuvr,ontario,t5_2qsf3,NA
CaptainSwoon,"It's not a legal issue but a moral issue. Sure, they can prioritize their health over others, that's what everyone does. But that's where the nuance comes in. They aren't actually weighing all the risks and impacts (I'm generalizing and assuming here, because I've yet to hear a single anti-vaxxer actually comment on or understand the risks to other people). It's not an unknown person they will be putting at risk, but someone they know. For Covid specifically, every child under 12 they come in contact with they are putting at risk, for example.

I'm fully vaccinated but still at risk due to an autoimmune disease (body won't make as effective of antibodies), so I've been cutting out everyone I know who won't get the Covid vaccine because I'm prioritizing my own health. I've explained this to some people I know and they've gone and got the vaccine, because they simply had never considered the risks they bring to others.

Flayed_Angel,"Doesn't mention what some of their issues with it are but I can give you one that I know will happen.

Member releases detail indicating they don't have the vaccine or they only got one and didn't get the second one because of a bad reaction or their doctor told them not to take it for a medical condition.

Job site has an outbreak and among the many tested the person in question tests positive.  That person is then blamed for spreading the virus to everybody.

The problem is we know the virus can be spread but vaccinated individuals.  The rate is irrelevant as management will not know if this person or a vaccinated person originally spread the virus or what the viral load of the individual is and even if they knew there is no way to know that the specific individual was the one that spread it to others.  Could they have?  Sure.  Did they?  There is absolutely no way of knowing that even if you tested every person every hour on the hour indefinitely.  Plus I'm pretty sure you can't do the rapid testing on people who had the virus or got the vaccine because they would flag as positive.

Having the person tested every few days, but not the vaccinated individuals as well, is meaningless if they have interactions with people.  Not everybody spreads the virus the same way.

Could you elaborate on why you think that ? Truly curious, not a gotcha. To me, and I'm just some dummy on the internet, it feels like so, so many of their stated justifications are after the fact to try to make their initial decision fit.

I understand that is your stance and I respect that. But now when I hear that I think of Milk. Milk does the body good milk makes healthier stronger bones. I grew up thinking this was science. I now know this is advertisement. 

I have had vaccines in the past so I do not see myself as Anti-vax but highly hesitant. My research lead me to want the J&amp;J vaccine but by the time I came to this conclusion I had done a lot more research and learned a lot.

I believe in our law system or perhaps better to say I had belief in our law system.

Each province has their own laws regarding health care. I know Ontario and B.C. Have consent laws and Dr's have sworn oaths to protect those laws. There is a law definition of what is consent and the elements of consent. The federal mandates made it impossible for someone like me to meet the elements of consent. 

If I got the vaccine so I could return to work or travel. I did not meet the elements of consent. If I got the vaccine because I wanted its protection I meet the elements of consent. 

 I wasn't sure and still am not sure now but I signed something in good faith saying I would let my employer know my vaccine status. I wasn't sure if I wanted to return to work while I still did not want to lose my job. 

If I got the vaccine because I wanted its protection but still wanted to stay at home while I sort my life out. I was obligated (or at least that is what I have been told by management) to notify them so I can return to work. 

So on days I though maybe I should get the vaccine I also thought that I wasn't ready to return to work and how I still felt my charter rights have been violated. If I get the vaccine I will have to notify my employer and return to work. 

This is why we have consent laws. These deciding decision in my case are not based on medical science. They are based on political pressure and coercion.

Hate me because I do not share your views. I'm ok with that. I see it no different as someone hating on a religion you have every right to do so.  What I am not ok with is our rights being stomped on by a PM who keeps breaking them.

Blue_Spruce,"I mean, I'm the same way. Young, healthy, low risk of dying from covid. 

I still got the vaccine because it's just a way of training my immune system to be *even more robust*. If your goal is to promote your own bodily health as much as possible, vaccines absolutely help in that. They train your natural immune system to be better equipped against specific infections.

That means if you happen to get exposed to covid, rather than being sick for a few days, you're more likely not to get sick at all. What's not to love here?

It's like arguing you don't need to train more because you're already in good shape. You can always be in *better* shape, and the risk of injury from vaccination is, to borrow your saying, essentially null unless you're very frail or one of those people who is allergic to almost everything.

JustMeStoppingBy,"&gt;Ironically that's another strawman from you.

You've really got to stop using terms you don't understand, especially when the whole premise of your comment revolves around engaging in what you are accusing others of doing.

&gt;Nope. I was literally arguing with a person in this very thread who held both those beliefs and insisted he wasn't hypocritical by doing so. Stop denying that these people exist and are prevalent.

First of all I never once denied the people could exist.

Second of all, they aren't being hypocrites for having different opinions on two unrelated subjects.

How to deal with drug addiction and how to tackle a viral pandemic are two entirely separate subjects, no matter how hard you want to try to tie them together.

&gt;So you say, with zero proof. Meanwhile in places who did the same thing, it did increase vaccinations:  
&gt;  
&gt;[https://www.curbed.com/2021/07/nyc-vaccine-incentive-100-de-blasio.html](https://www.curbed.com/2021/07/nyc-vaccine-incentive-100-de-blasio.html)  
&gt;  
&gt;In June, New Mexico offered $100 in cash to people who got fully vaccinated over a period of four days. The number of Johnson &amp; Johnson shots administered during that time quadrupled to over 2,000 per day statewide (since the single-shot option was the quickest way of getting the money). In Columbus, Ohio, there was a 289 percent increase in vaccinations during the first week of the city‚Äôs recently launched $100 Vax Cash program.

Remember what I said in my very first comment?

*$100 is not going to matter to the majority of unvaccinated. Being left on the sidelines as the rest of us get back to normal will.*

In New Mexico, 28% of people were unvaccinated when they offered $100 mid-June. It's been 1.5 months and they are now sitting at 22% unvaccinated.

This means approximately 90,000 people got the vaccine since mid-June.

[31,000 doses were given in the past 7 days alone](https://cvvaccine.nmhealth.org/public-dashboard.html), a full 1/3 of the amount vaccinated since they were offering money, and a shot rate of over 2x what it was for $100.

Know what changed? In August they announced vaccine mandates for workers in various settings, including hospitals and schools. Proof of vaccination will also be required to attend next week's state fair.

&gt;But I'm sure you'll have some proof to support your claim that payouts will actually do little to nothing to increase vaccinations, right?
&gt;
&gt;Or is this where you disappear and/or bluster some more but continue to give zero proof for your argument?

happykgo89,"At this point, the % of eligible people vaccinated is only useful in determining uptake (and this doesn‚Äôt matter nearly as much as the % of *the entire population* fully vaccinated, which determines the level of spread and thus risk in the community. 

What I am saying is that the way uptake is now (less than 60% fully vaccinated), since children under 12 are only ~15% of the population, unless people in other demographics start to get vaccinated, we won‚Äôt hit 80% fully vaccinated even if every kid under 12 got the vaccine (since 60% fully vaccinated, where we are right now and are kind of stagnating, plus 15% is 75% fully vaccinated). That still leaves several Albertans to be accounted for. 

The only way we can hope to improve this is to make sure everyone that gets their first dose gets their second (which isn‚Äôt necessarily the case - many thought one was enough when 70% with one dose was the re-opening target, many experienced reactions or are fearful and don‚Äôt want to get it again, etc). 

If 70% of eligible Albertans are fully vaccinated by the time we‚Äôre able to vaccinated kids under 12 (which I hope we reach, (I‚Äôm hopeful we hit 80% but it‚Äôs not all that likely even with the rush for some to get vaccinated because of the rising cases), that means that ~70-80% of the population under 12 will get vaccinated since the numbers will likely correspond with those of the demographics of their parents, which does range. Since the under 12s make up 15% of the population, if 80% of that demographic got the vaccine, that still only adds up to ~100,000 kids. Since we still have over a million unvaxxed and kids don‚Äôt typically end up in the hospital, our healthcare system is still at risk even if we do vaccinated children.

xxavierx,"On vaccine hesitency:

&gt;De Villa: I think the more significant work that's happening now is actually trying to address vaccine hesitancy. **And I think one of the most compelling things to reduce vaccine hesitancy is that when they see their fellow healthcare workers getting vaccinated and actually being successfully protected against COVID-19.** That's perhaps one of the most compelling pieces of evidence. It's real life, it's people that you can see. What we've found here in Toronto, as people are witnessing firsthand the benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine and the protection that it affords, is that people are increasingly asking for the vaccine. They might have taken a pass on it at the beginning, but now they're actually saying, hey, you know what, this might actually be worth my time in trouble now because I can see that it actually is beneficial, and I don't see people being harmed by the vaccine. That's a really good news story that we're seeing the protective benefits for residents and for those staff who choose to get the vaccine. And that real world evidence is actually compelling people to rethink decisions to not take the vaccine before.

On returning to normal:

&gt;De Villa: I think more than just a few of us are curious about this and there isn't a simple answer to this one. There's definitely light at the end of the tunnel. We know those vaccines are effective, and we know what it takes to reduce the spread of COVID-19. I think the short answer here is this -- the more we're able to follow those self-protection measures for now, and the sooner we're able to take up vaccine when our turn becomes available for each of us, I would just take up that vaccine.

Yea, no, lady it's been a year. People have lost a year of their lives and some have lost significantly more than others and we'll be dealing with the long term consequences of these decisions for years if not decades. People want to know there is a light/reward at the end of the tunnel. Suggesting that the most compelling thing to reduce vaccine hesitancy is seeing other get it and be successfully protected against COVID-19 isn't going to cut it when they'll just brush it off that their risk was low to begin with (and now doubly so because others got the vaccine so they don't have to). 

Perhaps we should try something similar to what some European countries are doing with posters of vaccinated people with messaging like ""I did it so I can hug my grandkids/go back to normal/grab a pint at the pub with friends"" rather than this idea that the good feeling inside your heart will be enough and being vague about when/if we'll ever return to normal. UK has set a goal date, US has now set a goal date...and here we are, floundering. 

Who needs Facebook and the ilk spreading vaccine misinformation from anti-vaxxers when you have public health officials messaging the vaccine with such apathy and indifference instilling in the public a sense of ""why bother?"" if none of this is going to end with vaccines. The messaging should be simple: more vaccines=faster return to normal. Like FFS act a little excited.",1615549909,gqoiypg,t3_m3axro,t3_m3axro,toronto,t5_2qi63,NA

Working kept me sane to be honest, outside the house though. My mom is single household so I visit her with the kids once a week. My whole family got the vaccine so once gathering is allowed, we will have outdoor BBQ.

I suffered bad agorophobia for many years and when Covid started I was terrified that would end up back to square one after many years of progress. Working away from home saved me.

If I had to work from home, I‚Äôd fight to work at the office (and from what I hear no private company objects to this unless they have an outbreak... which obviously rather be at home).

I‚Äôm with everyone else, break the lock down measures if need too. I would have went back to that park 2 hours later.

Note: I used to purposely drive into traffic jams in Montreal to force the anxiety to come out and win against... man those were dark days. You really can do it, I‚Äôm confident.

IVTD4KDS,"&gt; But my comment is about the employees

Great! In that case, yes, they should show that they are fully vaccinated. I'm a medical school instructor and the university stipulated that all faculty/students/staff be fully vaccinated in order to return to campus and submit proof to their HR as we are transitioning away from online distance education back to in-person learning. I did that, and now I'm allowed back into my office. I expect the students to be fully vaccinated when they return in a few weeks' time.

&gt;Also, kids can get out of needing vaccination with very little effort today

Unfortunately, that is something that needs to be phased out. I don't know of any religion (as an example) that requires their followers to not be vaccinated against diseases. Unless there is a very specific medically-backed reason as to why the employee/student/admin/whoever else cannot get vaccinated, then I can accept that - but in that case, they are also extremely vulnerable and should depend on everyone else to get vaccinated too. One's freedoms also carries responsibilities as well. That's our social contract.

Das_Dumme_Kinde,"Hey, totally understand the frustration. I wouldn‚Äôt the deny any one their right to feel emotions one way or another. 

My contention is with how those emotions interfere with people‚Äôs analysis and dealings with this situation. I do see lots of comments that directly and outrightly state ‚ÄúI hate unvaccinated people‚Äù or statements that seek only to belittle and de humanize them. There are certainly people who are unvaccinated for reasons I would shake my head at. But the straw manning of the unvaccinated as a single, clumped, walking hive mind with all the same values and reasons for not taking the vaccine is by in large part, a huge error. Someone‚Äôs vaccination status tells you nothing of how selfish they are, or that they lack empathy. It tells you nothing of how they‚Äôve interfaced with covid. Just as status as someone who has been vaccinated doesn‚Äôt tell you the same thing, maybe they only got the vaccine so they could rationalize not taking covid as seriously anymore. Opting to renounce their decision to remain unvaccinated as as such takes us further away from having a discussion with them. It takes us further away from solving this issue.

&gt;The point is that if you get COVID, the antibodies seem to decrease over time like it does in a vaccine.

Based on latest studies natural immunity is still better, to no ones surprise. I hate to quote Israel again but look at them, 4th shot? Thats the definition of doing the same thing while expecting a different outcome.

&gt;The point is that getting vaccinated helps keep you out of a hospital, and helps curb the spread to others. The point is that our hospitals are literally full of unvaccinated people.

Umm what? Unless you the watch mainstream news, that are after clicks, hospitals are not overrun. The news tend to make a sensation about it all the time without anyone digging into it, and when some do, you realize they made a headline because one day of the week they reached er capacity, following which they had to use contingency lol, or something along these lines. What is worse is that our health care system was shit way before covid, so dont blame covid or unvaccinated but blame the government who had all this time to fix it and didn't. Hospitals are also usually understaffed with a few nurses for a ton of patients, not because they dont have enough people, but because they dont hire enough and in some cases follow protocal based on ""a shit ton of patient to 1 nurse"".

&gt; The point is that in some areas, doctors will need to start deciding who gets treated and who doesn‚Äôt.

Tell me where I said that.

&gt; There was an outbreak in Massachusetts and vaccinated people had similar viral loads and can, and do, spread the virus to others.

It seems like there have been a number of studies on this and they are returning different findings so I don't think either of us are right on this one. This is also a VERY difficult thing to measure since people behave differently and behavior is a big factor on how the virus spreads; like you said (albeit with a weird chip on your shoulder) people who are vaccinated are probably going to be less cautious in private because they feel they don't need to be, but on the other hand you could argue unvaccinated people may be less cautious because they don't care about precautions.

The vaccines ARE powerful. They're also leaky. But it's funny, I always see people who are anti-vax saying why would you live in fear etc etc. I got the vaccine so I don't have to.

thevenomousmuse,"Alright. I'll bite as an educated (and by that I mean someone who has done research while not sitting on the crapper - the doctorate on my wall says so!) Individual who was in RIH watching this fuckery unfold.

Argument 1) the vaccine does not stop transmission:

That is correct, it does not stop transmission. This is a question of efficacy and effectiveness. In terms of efficacy - a study by McGill said that for an individual exposed after receiving the vaccine (Pfizer in this case), they were only 5% as likely as their non-vaccinated counterpart to get the vaccine during clinical control trials. In other words, the Pfizer vaccine is 95% effective in best case conditions.
In terms of effectiveness (not ideal conditions aka the real world), individual who were double vaccinated, there was a 92% were effective at preventing infection. This does not mean that they did not have it, but rather IF they had it, the viral load was so low, it was negligeable that the vaccine would be transferred. 

Argument 2) The vaccine hasn't been rigorously tested

Earth has been a petri-dish for almost two years and being the first vaccine to market represents big money. There has been a lot of research on the vaccine through cross populational studies. We know long term effects through comparing a 75 year old who got the vaccine to a 16 year old who got the vaccine. So no, we haven't followed the 16year olds across their lifespan to when they are 75, but we have a good idea of what will happen cause science.

Argument 3) there have been no clinical trials done on pregnant or breast feeding women:

There never are in modern vaccine trials. Look up thalidomide to find out why. Pregnant and breast feeding women are often excluded from drug trials because no research group wants the burden of potentially deforming fetuses, or causing maternal and/or fetal death, that is not a justifiable risk to an internal review board. The safety of a vaccines in this population are usually established through retrospective studies. In the meantime, this population relies on herd immunity to keep them safe until there is a large enough sample of full term pregnancies of pregnant women who chose to have the vaccine in order to look at effects. The same is true fot other immunocompromised individuals. Vaccines are first tested on the ideal demographic of healthy average Joe's (stage 1), and then the more at risk populations after that (stage 2 and beyond). There is no great cover-up by the CDC of MOH, this is standard practice.

Argument 3) the vaccine has not been trialed on pregnant women

Standard practice is that pregnant women and infants are excluded from drug trials because the risk versus the hypothetical reward is not there - please research thalidomide to see what I mean. Efficacy (not effectiveness) is studied retrospectively by looking at pregnant women who chose to have the vaccine while pregnant. It is near impossible to convince an internal review board to potentially subject this population to harm for drug trials and so very few vaccines can claim that they are safe for pregnant women.

Argument 4) my personal risk versus my personal reward

Take a hard look at that statement friend and try to see how selfish you sound to the people who legitimately cannot have the vaccine. Let me tell you what happens if you get the second choice of the worst case scenario - you get ICU level sick and survive

I work in inpatient rehab and have worked with individuals who have critical illness myopathy. That is what happens when your muscles waste away while you are lying in bed. The scarring in your lungs will fuck you up for a lifetime. There is a study happening at MSJ in Vancouver looking at Covid encephalopathy (a nasty brain injury) which can occur in some individuals who have had Covid.

Pocket_Hedgehog,"Plus, from what I have seen working as a home care nurse, the number of fully vaccinated people who now believe they are completely immune to the virus and therefore have stopped following any sort of precautions at all. I can't believe how many homes I go into, only to have **patients tell me that it is okay for me to take of my mask because they are fully vaccinated**. Like no. That is not how any of this works. We need vaccines, hand hygiene, masks, etc. all together to help prevent cases and overwhelming the hospitals and ICUs, and to protect our most vulnerable (people who cannot get vaccinated for medical reasons, the elderly, children under twelve). It's not a matter of pick and choose - I got the vaccine so I don't need a mask, or I wear a mask so I don't need the vaccine. We need them all together. I don't care if my clients are double dosed and believe they are invincible. I will continue wearing my mask for a long time.

Obviously many cases are cause by unvaccinated people spreading the virus, but let's not overlook those vaccinated people who are throwing all caution to the wind. These people (I think they are in the same class of idiots as antivaxers), can still spread the virus and the problem is that, if they are asymptomatic, they will spread the virus on to others at an increased rate without even realizing it.

Once the vaccine goes into your arm, you've rolled the dice on an 1:100000 chance of execution.

With Covid, you have to first get infected. Which means that with covid, you need to calculated a complex, individual risk profile where local incidence plays a role, personal habits (how many contacts someone has any given day or week), age, over all health, etc. etc.

The people who died in Germany were young and healthy. The combined risk for them with Covid is 1:several million (local incidence in German cities was below 100/100000 at the time they got vacced, so even catching it wasn't very likely to begin with).

25K have died in Canada since the start of the pandemic. 86% of those deaths were over the age of 70. 90% of Canadians age 70+ have received at least one dose of the vaccine so far. Barring unforeseen changes to the virus that make it exponentially deadlier, I don't see how Canada would experience ""hundreds of thousands"" more deaths even if not a single additional person got vaccinated after today.

cseckshun,"That‚Äôs actually a pretty massive cost for each person when you scale it to the entire country and take into account that total healthcare spending was about $5,074 per person in 2019 pre-pandemic. It would be 10% of the previous total healthcare spending just for ONE vaccination incentive. Over the course of the pandemic healthcare spending increased to an estimated $8,019 per person in 2021 which is a huge increase from 2019 (60% increase is massive) but when you consider that one single action to get more people vaccinated would account for a 10% increase by itself you start to realize the actual cost of incentives like that. There is also a cost associated with administering and implementing a program to add/change tax deductions/laws/forms.

If you look at how many people got vaccinated after they implemented the $100 giveaway in Alberta you can see that the program didn‚Äôt actually create a clear increase in the vaccination rates so it is dubious whether a $500 incentive would do much at the federal level.

On September 3 there were 5.663506M doses administered and on October 14 there were 6.315648M doses administered so a total of 652,142 doses administered during that 41 day time period.

Looking at the 41 day period after the $100 incentive program ended there were 6.315648M doses administered on October 14 and on November 24 there were 6.798577M doses administered so a total of 482,929 doses administered.

If we look at the 41 days before the vaccine incentive program was instated there were 5.264139M doses administered as of July 24 and then 5.663506M doses administered as of September 3. This means 399,367 doses were administered in that timeframe.

To be fair I‚Äôll take the average of 399,367 and 482,929 to try to approximate what the unincentivized vaccine administration rate could have been for the 41 days between September 3 and October 14. I get 441,148 doses as a rough estimate but we know that with the incentive we actually had 652,142 doses administered so it may have increased the total doses administered by 210,994 which if we take the absolute most generous interpretation of the data would mean that all those people were getting their first shot and they all went on to get fully vaccinated that we had 210,994 people get fully vaccinated because of the incentive. Keep in mind this is wildly generous as an assumption. Because we only gave the incentive to people who got their first doses it likely wasn‚Äôt all of the 210,994 people who got it but if we are assuming on the high end that it made 210,994 people get a first dose and then go on to get fully vaccinated then it would have cost $21,099,400. The issues with giving the $100 incentive to EVERYONE got vaccinated is that for the same time period it would inspire a very similar number of people to get vaccinated but you would need to pay out to everyone who had previously been vaccinated as well! That means since there were 68.5% of Albertans on October 14 that were fully vaccinated and using the same Government of Alberta website assumption of 4.420039M Albertans we find that 3,027,726 Albertans were fully vaccinated at that point so add that times $100 to the total cost and you get a price tag of $302,772,600 to vaccinate an additional 210,994 people. That means the incentive would actually cost around $1434.98 per additional vaccinated person just in incentive costs.

I think I was pretty generous in the way I broke down the data and might have gotten a little carried away but I was curious to try to quantify the actual benefit from the program and couldn‚Äôt find anything from the government of Alberta on estimated success of the program.

I also think that this is a pretty ridiculous amount of money to spend on people who really don‚Äôt want to do anything out of their way to help our healthcare system or fellow canadians. Having looked at this info and breaking down the costs I think I‚Äôm actually much more supportive of levying a tax penalty than any incentive program for anti-vax holdouts. The pandemic has already strained our healthcare system and contributed to a massive (~60%) increase in healthcare costs and at this point spending a load of cash (~$1400/extra vaccinated person) to try to make people join society and do what‚Äôs right just doesn‚Äôt make sense to me.

At any rate I‚Äôm not trying to dunk on you or anything with the wall of text and numbers, I just enjoy getting into the numbers on shit like this but I am by no means an expert at healthcare policy or statistical analysis and this is just napkin math. If you actually take the time to read this I would love to get your thoughts on if you think I‚Äôm making sense or getting it totally wrong!",1643316844,huhnq9z,t3_sd4iv4,t1_hugdmyu,canada,t5_2qh68,NA

&gt;The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released a report on Oct. 29, 2021, that says getting vaccinated for the coronavirus when you‚Äôve already had COVID-19 significantly enhances your immune protection and further reduces your risk of reinfection.  
&gt;  
&gt;A study published in August 2021 indicates that if you had COVID-19 before and are not vaccinated, your risk of getting re-infected is more than two times higher than for those who got vaccinated after having COVID-19.  
&gt;  
&gt;Another study published on Nov. 5, 2021, by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) looked at adults hospitalized for COVID-like sickness between January and September 2021. This study found that the chances of these adults testing positive for COVID-19 were 5.49 times higher in unvaccinated people who had COVID-19 in the past than they were for those who had been vaccinated for COVID and had not had an infection before.

Downvote_Comforter,"He wasn't charged with any crime. The NHL and Sharks either refused to pass along their evidence to the state or they did and the state declined to press charges. The fact that something is a crime and a person was never charged with that crime doesn't make the conduct worse. I fully agree that faking a vax card is serious, but the fact that it is a crime is irrelevant. It is also noteworthy that he was disciplined for that conduct already.

We have no info that he falsified info at the border. If they can demonstrate he provided fraudulent info to enter Canada it will help their case. If he submitted a valid negative test at the border, then the only thing he violated was league protocol. So far they have only alleged a violation of league protocol. According to Friedman, they're saying he went to Canada 7 days after his positive test that put him in protocol. They confirmed that he actually got vaccinated after his suspension, so a negative test is pretty plausible. They (so far) haven't claimed that he was still positive when he travelled. Also, it's worth noting that the day he went to Vancouver was December 29, which is the same day the league changed their protocol from a 10 day quarantine to a  5 day quarantine after a positive test. At 7 days, he was only in violation if he travelled before that announcement. I assume that part of the PA's argument will be that they were aware that the protocol was changing that day, so it was reasonable to believe it applied that day.

mistial_dev,"Given that 80% of the people with severe outcomes are obese, and my parents are not obese and just barely over the age risk threshold, I'm still not particularly worried.

I got COVID.  They got COVID.  I got vaccinated (because I was in the US).  They are getting vaccinated.

More importantly, even if they get COVID during that two week wait period, they will be getting decent care in the US, not whatever the heck Ontario is doing.

The Canadian methodology tends to be ""if you test positive, go home, and go to the ICU if you have to"".  The US mentality, for those who can afford good healthcare, involves things like [EUA monoclonal antibodies](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibodies-treatment-covid-19), which can help avoid the whole ""going to the ICU"" thing in the first place.

Heck, I've got friend who's a doctor.  He follows a protocol that involves a cocktail of antivirals, corticosteroids as an anti-inflammatory, and an antithrombotic drug.  His patients, as a general rule do comparatively extremely well.  There are several treatment centers in Texas that are following that protocol, based in part off the results seen in Italy.  If they get sick, I'm sending them to him.

One benefit of hiring my mother is that they get my corporation's insurance.  It's horrifically expensive (thanks ObamaCare), especially with the HSAs we provide that pays the deductibles, but there's literally no reason for people not to get the care they need.  We've got paid time off, paid sick leave, paid vacation, paid disability.

It's been a real lifesaver for me over the years, when my allergy-induced migraines were debilitating and Ontario put me on a 4 year waitlist.  It's been the worst part of the border closures, and why we're moving back to BC.  Healthcare isn't just a nice to have, it's absolutely necessary, and the way Ontario is handling things in general is a disgrace.",1617946894,gtwfloe,t3_mn4dhv,t1_gtw8s6i,canada,t5_2qh68,NA

Since I'm WFH, am nowhere near the age/occupational groups that can be vaccinated, I would be waiting forever to get a shot in Ontario. The mentality here is that if there are shots remaining, you're going to get one. I got vaccinated because the pharmacy near my house called me to say that they have some extra vaccines and if I want to get one, I should go immediately.

Putting a waitlist of people seems like a no-brainer. Even if those who aren't at a high risk of getting COVID-19 get vaccinated, they help to protect the ones who are vulnerable to getting it.

I just didn‚Äôt think we would be worse off than ever this far into the pandemic. Couple that with the vaccine being dangled like a carrot (at risk category finally being opened up‚Ä¶ to be the only one with a 40+ age restriction when I turn 39 this year) and it‚Äôs really been hard. I‚Äôve been suffering bouts of depression and it‚Äôs manifested in other ways too. Not being able to control the vaccine, i‚Äôve been a lot more sensitive when I can‚Äôt follow through on daily things that I feel should be under my control still. It‚Äôs just been really stressful since I have several things on the list for the at risk category and watch others who are healthier get their shots because they turned 40 last year.

Tbh it's probably more risky getting the shot then thinking you're perfectly safe and disregarding all previous rules. You still have to be cautious. We're not out of the woods yet. 

Plus there's still people at risk. My mom has hesitated on getting the vaccine because she's not sure how it responds to MS and she's scared because she's heard of others with MS having negative reactions. There are good reasons for being hesitant about the vaccine. We just don't know for sure the long term effects yet, even though we can kinda guess at them (with the vaccine being based on a previous one), but we can't necessarily be 100% sure.

weddingthrowaway7628,"A couple problems with your numbers;

**NS Population**: You include children in this number. This means it is more than 6% unvaccinated

**X healthcare workers could leave**: This assumes several things --

* Healthcare workers are vaccinated at the same rates as the general population. Might be true; one would hope it isn't.
* Non-medical staff would be relatively easy to replace
* None of the unvaccinated would become vaccinated to keep their jobs. I know you said ""could"", but this is the big point, because I wager most will. Every unvaccinated person I know are not hard core anti-vax, but are mostly ""lazy"" and ""unconcerned"" (because, I expect, NS has done a good job of protecting them). I know people who are getting vaccinated because they were going to be mildly inconvenienced. I know people who got vaccinated because their job required it already.

For that last one, we have real world data to look at, particularly in the wildly anti-vax USA. Lets see what their numbers say:

* [North Carolina](https://www.axios.com/novant-health-north-carolina-vaccine-mandate-9365d986-fb43-4af3-a86f-acbb0ea3d619.html) 0.5% -- 175/~35000
* [Texas](https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2021-06-22/houston-covid-vaccine-fired) 0.6% -- 153/~25,000
* [New Jersey]() 0.2% -- 6/2,979

One article I found in New York was shocking:

* [New York](https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/new-york-fires-unvaccinated-health-care-workers.html) 11% -- ~5,000/~43,000

So basically the number who ""could"" leave is basically not calculable based off of the normal population numbers, so before we run about in panic perhaps we should wait for real numbers.

JAN 2020 - Low chance of community spread. Virus not airbourne and not spread easily from person to person. No need to stop or quarantine flights from China.   
FEB 2020 - Don't wear masks, they will cause respiratory issues from long-term wear.   
APR 2020 Non-medical cloth masks recommended in public to protect wearers from this airbourne virus. 
JUL 2020 Everyone really, really needs to wear a mask because it is our only protection until a vaccine. Masks do not protect the wearer, only others.  
JAN 2021 Covid vaccines are safe and 95% effective...

I do however realize that there are vulnerable populations that are likely to be impacted much more than myself, and there is danger in the aggregate to the medical system and our capacity to care for people.  

So I got vaccinated because it is best for all of us, not because it is necessarily best for me.  There are a ton of ways in which we curtail societal harm by acting in the best interests of the whole, this vaccine is just one more example.   

A great comparison to the Covid vaccine would be the Rubella virus vaccine, a vaccine which is so prevalent in Canada that Rubella has been eliminated.

However if you happen to be a pregnant woman of an unborn baby you are at severe risk from a Rubella infection and the fetus could contract congenital rubella syndrome.  Aside from the heightened probability of miscarriage and stillbirth an infant with congenital rubella syndrome often has vision, hearing, heart, and developmental problems among others.

Do I as a male need to be vaccinated for Rubella?  From a personal perspective, no.  But if I were to consider the impacts of that decision on others then I am very glad to have been vaccinated for Rubella, and I am very glad we got our shit together on a national level and solved the problem.  

Acting with consideration for others isn't fear driven, for me at least it is driven by mutual respect and a sense of doing what is right for myself and for others.",1636640878,hk7ek5p,t3_qri8as,t1_hk71r8c,canada,t5_2qh68,NA

elbiderca,"More people got vaccinated because of the Saskatchewan government‚Äôs proof of vaccination policy, according to a new study.

The paper, from the University of Saskatchewan‚Äôs Social Contours and COVID-19 research team, shows more people received first and second doses after Premier Scott Moe announced the province‚Äôs new proof of vaccination system on Sept. 16.

First doses more than doubled, and second doses increased between Moe‚Äôs announcement and Oct. 1, when the requirement went into effect.Would-be entrants to venues like bars and concerts can also show a recent negative COVID-19 test, but must pay for the test themselves if they are not experiencing symptoms of the disease, or have come in close with someone infected, among other conditions.

But since the system came into effect, the rates of first doses have dropped while the rate of second doses plateaued.

One of the authors of the study told Global News the declining rate of first doses and constant rate of second doses is a good thing. It means the people who are getting their first doses are getting their second.

Nazeem Muhajarine said he expects the number of people getting their second dose to drop in a few weeks as well, once the people who were open but perhaps hesitant to getting vaccinated got their shots.

‚ÄúWe knew that when we introduce proof of vaccination policies, it would move people who are maybe‚Ä¶ on the fence, not for ideological reasons, not value-based reasons for refusing vaccines, but mostly because of convenience to get vaccinated,‚Äù he said.

However, he said the policy hadn‚Äôt reached everyone.

‚ÄúI would have wished that it could have continued to reach those hardcore vaccine refusers,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúbut we do know that the vaccine policy itself is probably not going to convert those people.‚Äù

A new national survey from the Angus Reid Institute, a public opinion research foundation, shows 58 per cent of unvaccinated people who aren‚Äôt sure if they will get the jab say personal freedom and health concerns are their main reasons for not getting the shot.

Legitimate_Policy,"I only got vaccinated because my family said I couldn't see my siblings if I didn't get the shot. To be honest the reason I was hesitant wasn't for fear of the vaccines or their medical side effects. The reason I was hesitant was becuase I don't know jack shit about science or medicine so whenever I hear a conclusion regarding those things the only way I can evaluate it is based on the credibility of the source. To pretend as many of us do to understand the science is stupid. I'm smart enough to know that I'm too stupid to make an informed assessment of this pandemic.  So it all comes down to trust and trust is the one thing that has been so horribly eroded in this pandemic. I didn't want to get the shot because I didn't trust that the media or the government had my best interests at heart. I didn't trust them because I felt like I was seen as an inferior, a person who must be bludgeoned with fear and shame and hate rather than reasoned with in good faith. Between the propaganda, fear-mongering, and my first real taste of the frightening scope of state power I was afraid of these powerful people. I still am afraid of these powerful people. How can I trust a group who tells me to trust them but lies constantly?  How can I trust a group whose first appeal is to my hatred and  fear rather than my reason?

This is the dilemma of a modern democracy: the majority of the population is too ignorant or stupid (myself included) to make informed judgements about major issues, but how can we be a functioning democracy if the answer is a constant stream of propaganda? If we accept that the average person is so stupid that they need their opinions made for them then why even be a democracy? Why not just restrict voting rights to people who score well on IQ tests and let the smart people decide?

oldsouthnerd,"I can't comment directly on the data you're discussing wrt to unvacced under 50 accounting for only 7% of hospitalizations. If you can provide a source I'm interested in learning more though.

I usually work from the official government epidemiology update 

https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/epidemiological-summary-covid-19-cases.html

You can view about 90% of the way down the page outcomes by age for hospitalization, icu admission and death. As you point out younger ages are very unlikely to die, but a significant portion of them still end up in ICU. The 40-70 age range is particularly highly represented in ICUs.

But the under 50 crowd is still over 20% of hospital and ICU admission. Can't say for sure if that jives with 7% of hospitalized being under 50 and unvaxxed, but both could be true.

That said, consider a few points

* Trying to knock those 7% of hospitalizations down to the 1 or 2 they would be if vaxxed is worth it.
* Saying mandates targeting under 50 are not good at reducing hospitalization ignores that many people under 50 got vaccinated because of mandates that already happened, has already saved healthcare resources
* Mandating vaccines for certain jobs doesn't take a lot of energy or focus, so it's not like we're doing this at the expense of vaccinating seniors
* 50 isn't a good cut off point, the average canadian trucker is over 40 and a very large proportion of them are over 50. A very significant portion of the age demographic in hospitals is represented by truckers: https://www.rocktoroad.com/average-age-of-truck-drivers-still-rising-2495/

Anything in medicine is looking at cost vs benefit. Vaccine mandates don't cost us much, and they have been shown to increase vaccination which is a huge benefit. I agree that we need to do more to target unvaxxed seniors, but unvaxxed workers take way less energy to mandate because we're just making it a requirement for work.

Doctor_Amazo,"&gt;But do you

Yes. Thus my support of mandates for vaccines and masks, and why I think that it's stupid to remove both just so he can appease a violent and ignorant group of domestic terrorists to vote for him.   


&gt;But do you think vaccine mandates are going to convince anyone else to get vaccinated?

Considering how many people I talked to who were convoy supporters and angry about the mandates but who got vaccinated because of the mandates because they didn't want to face the consequences of not being vaccinated? Yeah. I know they work.   


&gt;They have had about a year to do so, if they haven't gotten it at this point, its highly unlikely they ever will

Except that mandates haven't really been around for a year. Vaccines have.  And folks were first asked nicely to get it. We tried educating them about vaccines to let them know they're safe. We provide all sorts of data that shows they are clearly safe AND effective at fighting COVID. Vaccines are clearly the way to beat the pandemic and get back to a somewhat normal way of life... and they refused because they deny facts.   


Mandates resulted because of their refusal to accept reality and facts.   


And unfortunately, mandates weren't applied uniformly. For instance, they mostly started being implemented so deny customers access to a venue, but there were no real mandates for workers being vaccinated.  And even then, unionized work places all fought against those kinds of mandates, preferring to have a compromise where  a person basically promises they had the vaccine without proving it, or in other places they just have to pass a COVID test to ""prove"" they don't have COVID.    


It was only when vaccine mandates were pushed far enough so that people actually *had to prove* their vaccination status or face suspension without pay or even being fired that we started seeing vaccine appointments going up, and we also saw Freedumb Fighters getting upset at having to face consequences.   


Too bad for them.  


&gt;At what point would you be comfortable removing the vaccine mandate?

When COVID is not a threat domestically and internationally.... because again, this policy is only detrimental to those people who refuse to do the adult thing and get the vaccine. I have 0 compassion for people making that choice. I instead reserve my compassion for all the medically compromised people who have no choice here, and desperately need for everyone to behave like adults and get vaccines. THOSE people should be the ones with all the privileges in society, not anti-vaxxers.   


&gt; If the only reason to have a vaccine mandate is to punish people, then that is not based on science, but on resentment for others decisions. 

That's a nonsense sentence.   


The science is that vaccines work. The politics is that we impose mandates to get people vaccinated and protect those who cannot be vaccinated.   


I support mandates to protect those people who are endangered by COVID and by extension endangered by the reckless behaviour of anti-vaxxers.   


&gt;Theres no scientific reason to continue with vaccine mandates.

wondroustrange,"If you cannot see that some businesses excluding someone for wearing red or not wearing a tie is different from asserting the right of every private business to exclude you on the basis of not undergoing a medical procedure, then there‚Äôs nothing more I can say except that you are simplifying the problem posed by the intersection of rights and public health. Private businesses do not have unlimited capacity to discriminate, as we know, for example  in the case of protected classes. To let every private business, if they so wished, exclude a group of people on the basis of medical procedures, is indeed an exception to our normal understanding of things‚Äîit may be a necessary one, or it may be right to allow it, but to say it‚Äôs just freedom of choice as we‚Äôve normally understood it, is, I think, to obfuscate the problem. Mandating what people do with respect to their own health care decisions in order to earn access to a broad range of features of ordinary life is a new problem, or at least a new problem insofar as the scale of it has come to encompass the whole society. 

Out of curiosity, if an organization made it a rule that it would fire anyone who had had an abortion, would you find that a legitimate exercise of freedom? What if they had to show medical records that proved they‚Äôd never undergone it?

I don‚Äôt even necessarily disagree with the vaccine mandates; at least I got vaccinated because I saw no good reason not to, and my motives were a mixture of a desire for my own safety, convenience, and the public good. But repeating the empty slogan ‚Äòfreedom of choice is not freedom from consequences‚Äô ad nauseam sheds no light on ‚Äòfreedom of choice‚Äô as a political concept. In my view, the proper way to go about talking about this is to own the fact that ‚Äòfreedom of choice‚Äô is a socially mediated right, is subject to notions of a common good, and that there is a permissible range of situations where it can be suspended or modified. People who did not get vaccinated did not have freedom of choice in the salient political sense, in my view.",1646497264,hzgrz22,t3_t7af18,t1_hzgmmyc,toronto,t5_2qi63,NA

Beyond that, there are a variety of different reasons people might have chosen to either get vaccinated or not get vaccinated:

- Some got vaccinated because they're worried about getting really sick from COVID.

- Some got vaccinated because they think it'll prevent them from spreading it to others (regardless of the validity of those concerns).

- Some got vaccinated because they don't want to deal with restrictions or masking.

- Some got vaccinated just because everyone else is doing it and so they feel societal pressure to do so.

- Some didn't get vaccinated because they've seen legitimate stories about people becoming seriously ill due to the vaccination (regardless of the validity of those concerns).

Vaccinated people spread COVID at the same rate, it only protects you if you are old and sick - you will get less sicker. I used to live in Tbay (why I'm here) but here in BC they brought back masks everywhere despite a high vax rate. This is because it's spreading everywhere but what they are not saying is that is spreading among the vaccinated and unvaccinated - they are letting people assume it's only spreading by the vaccinated and  certain political people are saying ""we must protect the vaccinated from the unvaccinated"" have ZERO science behind that.

If you are vaccinated you ARE protected from the unvaccinated. You can spread it at catch it just as easy. I caught COVID in the spring when it came out when my Mom came back from Mexico and I picked her up from the airport (I think). She had something (from flying/travel - felt like a nose thing for a week she said) and I left nothing. We both got tested and we had it. I never felt a thing. Asymptomatic carriers are everywhere - and they were BEFORE the vaccine.

radioactivemagic,"36m here with 2 shots and 3rd scheduled for next week. I work within healthcare, no longer in everyday frontline care but I am in and out of facilities frequently across my province and across Canada -- even throughout the pandemic. I wear a mask, I wash my hands and I distance where possible.

Initially I got vaccinated because of my family:

1. To reduce the risk of serious illness or death.
2. To reduce the risk of spread. 

While you were sick and 'it wasn't bad' that is not always the case, and that was my primary concern. Myocarditis from the mRNA vaccines is widely publicized and sensationalized as a reason **not** to be vaccinated but COVID19 carries a much higher risk of myocarditis. More worrisome is **long COVID**, as my career requires a significant amount of problem solving, concentration and focus; if I develop long COVID, my job will be impacted and my team is already very lean so my business will be impacted. **Financially it would burden my family**. My daughter is at an age that isn't eligible to be vaccinated, and while COVID19 infection in children has been reported to be mild (in most cases) there are reports showing ~1/5th of children develop long COVID -- she is a toddler and rapidly developing, I have no idea what the effects of ~6 months to 1 year of brain suppression has long term but likely will delay her development, or potentially have long term effects mentally. [New research](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMc2033369) is showing much of the neurodegenerative aspects are potentially both short-term and long-term, which is my greatest concern with COVID19. 

There is also the burden aspect, where I am not one of the typical cases and potentially have a fatal incident -- while my family is well insured, we have a young daughter who would grow up without a father, a wife without a husband... while a very minor risk I do not see why I would not reduce that risk to as low as possible with a vaccination. Yes vaccinations can lead to adverse events, but the risk of a vaccination is much less than the risk brought by natural COVID19 infection. 

**Spread**

Initially with COVID19 I was vaccinated just after frontline due to my exposure potential. I did so mainly to prevent risk of spread within facilities I was visiting... all across Canada. Early on vaccination provided 85% immunity against spreading the virus, which was crucial as we still then knew of asymptomatic spread -- not having symptoms but spreading was a far scarier scenario for my profession, as I commonly encounter immunocompromised individuals or those who care for them. **With the emergence of Delta this protection against spread dropped significantly, and with Omicron even more so**. With this said, being vaccinated, and boosted, may not prevent you from being able to spread COVID19 **but it certainly reduces how long you are infectious for**. If you are shedding the virus for 5 days, rather than 10 days, it makes a difference on community impact. 

Now if I was in your scenario, with no shots onboard but also with 'natural immunity', I would still get vaccinated. My reasoning being vaccination + natural immunity is known to be the strongest immunity against COVID19; there have been individuals who have caught COVID 'twice' so to speak, and there will likely be further variants -- I want my immune system to have the latest and greatest dossier on the enemy before going to battle, again. 

Outside of the health aspect, these standards are not going away, and lacking proof of vaccination even with proof of prior infection will likely cause headaches I do not want to encounter as someone who has to fly 20-30 times per year.",1642447092,ht2p2a4,t3_s645kw,t1_ht1mzsn,canada,t5_2qh68,NA

Revolutionary-Win-51,"&gt;Bashing antivaxxers and not having any social interactions are two different things.

If and when our hospitals are overrun and there are inevitable some deaths from COVID and lack of access to healthcare will your Christmas dinner and NYE function still be justifiable?

&gt;We are now more than 2 years in. I've done my part. Majority of the people have done theirs. We are at around 85% vaccinated. I just don't understand why we cannot go back to life the way it was. 

We have a new variant that is resistant to our current Vaccination strategy. 


&gt;I got vaccinated because I believe the people who are responsible for this are doing their job. I didn't say I want Pfizer or moderna. I took whatever they had that day. They told me it works. I believed them.

It did. It worked exceptionally well for Delta, the variant that didn't exist when the vaccines were originally developed. 

&gt;If the vaccination works then why can't life go back to normal. If it's because of the 15% who are unvaccinated then HOW THE HELL IS THAT MY PROBLEM? either force them to get vaccinated or make THEM stay at home. Why do I have to do this. 

We're not continuing our plan to normalcy right now because we don't know how our healthcare system will look in 2 months after rapid spread of omicron. Our healthcare system is fragile right now. We cannot allow it to collapse. 

&gt;If we need to stay like this to ""stop the spread"" then when the hell does it stop? Why did we even get vaccinated if we have to stay at home. 

You don't have to stay home, you just can't think anymore that you're completely immune to getting it. You need to understand that this virus doesn't listen to us human, it's acting on its own. We're only reacting to it. 

Capacities are limited because your current vaccinations aren't enough to prevent infection like with other variants, it's looking like severe infection is still prevented, but not symptomatic infection. 

&gt;Somewhere along the process it doesn't make sense. I am not a high risk group. I should be able to go about my life after two years now. We are at a point now where the groups that are at a higher risk should have specific rules about them, instead of the whole population. Older people should continue to be careful. If you are immunocompromised then maybe you should be careful still. 

The problem with that line of thinking is that unchecked spread of an already highly contagious virus will lead to more death. 

The situation we're all in really sucks, *you* as in individual have done nothing wrong and you can't let yourself feel blame for that. 

The virus changed, unfortunately it happened when most of the province is 6 months after their 2nd dose which means our collective immunity is lower. You've done everything right.",1640299210,hpqlcyb,t3_rn69p1,t3_rn69p1,ontario,t5_2qsf3,NA

Getting vaccinated is for now anyways still a personal choice, you can chose to not get it, but be prepared to suffer the consequences just like with anything in life, your decisions will always have consequences, be it positive or negative ones. responsible and mature people understand this, the Freedumb Honkies obviously don't, so in essence they're children throwing a tantrum because they didn't get their way. The other 90% of truckers did and look, they can keep doing their job and go on with their lives just like before.

Ask ten people you know who were vaccinated and see if they or anyone they know had to take a week off work with extreme fatique about a week or two after vaccination (for 2/3 with that symptom, it happens after the 2nd dose)   

&gt;Double vaxxed people are absolutely not dying at the same rate as vaxxed. That's bullshit.
Most vaccinated and natural people are asymptomatic when they contract the virus, so we never know when they contract the virus...unless they get tested ... and that usually only happens if they've travelled. 
There is no change in that stat regardless of vaccination.  Right?  

We are only counting people who die of Covid, right?  So that means we only include the ones who get sick from Covid, right?  Fewer and fewer unvaccinated people are getting sick from Covid right now in most places, but more and more people who are vaccinated are getting sich from Covid. Why? Because more and more people are getting vaccinated ... and it doesn't stop you from contracting the virus or the diseases.  

But a person needs to get ""very sick"" to die from Covid. Right?  

Some people get very sick from Covid, vaccinated or not, and the very sick vaccinated people are are dying at the same rate as the very sick unvaccinated people.  

&gt;""No proof vaccines protect us from the virus"", that's bullshit.  
I realize that most people are not smart enough to understand that the 99%+ success rate claimed for the vaccine because 99% have not gotten sick is a farce because ... 99% of Canadians who are not vaccinated never get sick and THERE IS NO WAY TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT ALL THE VACCINATED PEOPLE WHO NEVER GOT SICK **EVER CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE VIRUS**.    It's  ridiculous.   Most cases are asymptomatic anyway, even without the vaccine. And some are fatal even after the vaccine. 
We only know about the ones who got sick and got a positive test ... and of course, all the ones who died from COVID despite being ""fully vaccinated"".   LIKE THESE ...

The only way to know whether or not your vaccinations protect you are if you get ill, quite ill, or die from Covid, because even if you test positive with no symptoms and never get sick ... that was the probability BEFORE you got vaccinated.  So your vaccination has ABSOLUTELY NO VALID CLAIM to protecting you if you test postitive and do not get sick...because that's probably what would have happend anyway.  Get it?   
( I mentioned it twice in case you missed it the first time. lol )  

&gt;The implication that polio vaccine was safe and effective only because it took decades to get it out, and therefore covid vaccine is dangerous is misleading enough to call it bullshit.   

I did not imply that the Salk IPV Polio vaccine was safe and effective ""only because it took decates to get it out"".    See, that's the problem - you have cognitive impairment or incompetence within this field of study. 
My statement indicated that creating a polio that was both safe and effective TOOK decades .... and THEN it went through years of trials to DETERMINE that it was BOTH safe AND effective before they LET it out...the part that maybe you're not aware of.  See, vaccine manufacturers usually do 2 phases of testing - small group (eg. 100) and medium group (.eg 1,000) and then they need to WAIT 2 years to see whether or not it actually works for most and if there were any weird consequences ... before HealthCanada will approve a trial on 10,000 or so people... and then they wait AGAIN for a few years to see, again, if it was both effective... and safe; the latter of which often takes years to determine.  If 4,000 out of 10,000 develope ear tumors or something ...they won't let that go to millions of people.   COVID vaccines didn't have those safety and efficacy test trial phases; you're IT!  

&gt;You mean to imply that the new vaccine is relatively untested by comparing something that they worked on in a small lab with no modern equipment, to something they've worked on for two decades with the benefits of modern scientific knowledge, modern technology, and billions of dollars in funding (yes, they were studying this family of virusses and working on vaccines well before COVID19 hit us).   

**Um... YES. That's exactly what I'm saying....because you're wrong.  This is a NEW virus. That's why the name ""NOVEL"" is in the name.  See, if it was as easy as you're making it out to be, we'd have a Delta Variant vaccine ""now""...one for HIV, too. But we don't, because it is far more difficult than you make it seem, and from reading what you wrote, it seems you don't know that anyone was injured or killed by the vaccine or that a lot of vaccinated people have gotten sick and even died...and that your chances of getting sick are not measurably different than before you got vaccinated....since most who contract the virus have NO symptoms**

Additionally, please provide any kind of data or source on your claim that people got vaccinated so that lockdowns could end - there‚Äôs none I could find.

In fact, vaccine hesitancy has remained very low, looking at March vs June 2021, at less than 4% of the population. Source: https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/healthandwellbeing/bulletins/coronavirusandvaccinehesitancygreatbritain/26mayto20june2021

cisco54,"1. Pfizer will likely be fully FDA approved this summer and no longer relying on emergency use approval so it will be as tested and approved as all the other vaccines you routinely get (like tetanus as you point out). 

2. This was so a vaccine will be developed. I fully expect this will be removed at some point one the emergency is over. But that's speculation on my part. 

3. The new variants are more deadly than the initial wave and is hitting the younger people harder probably because the older generation is fully vaccinated. As covid moves through hosts it gets more chances to mutate and possible become more virulent; for example the delta variant is far easier transmitted. 

4. The health complications of the vaccine is significantly lower than the complications from getting covid. For example there are estimated 4 million worldwide deaths from covid out of almost 200 million cases. In Canada there have been more than 36 million vaccines given and 1,700 adverse effects that were serious with fever than 50 deaths that may be attributable to the vaccine. 

5. You likely have a good immune system. The vaccine simple gives a portion of the covid vaccine for your immune system to learn how to combat it. It's similar to learning to drive a car - you pass some written tests, get a learner permit, take driver ed or learn on quiet streets before passing your driver test. Not getting a vaccine is like driving on an interstate highway the very first time you drive a car. 

6. Possible, but how do leaders of almost all countries from all political stripes agree on this one thing but nothing else. It's far more likely that covid really is an emergency and hoping it away doesn't work. We see countries that follow conspiracy theories and their death rate skyrockets compared to countries who follow the public health advice. 

7. There already is public control over so many aspects of our lives. Proof of vaccines have been around ever since there have been vaccines. Teachers could not teach without a TB vaccine and a negative TB test. Countries have demanded proof of a long list of vaccines before a person can travel there. This is nothing new. Nurses who refuses the flu vaccine still can work but must wear more PPE when at work, it's their choice but it comes with consequences. 

8. Wearing a condom does not eliminate all chances of getting pregnant but it reduces it greatly. Same as the vaccine. Studies continue but it appears that if a vaccinated person gets covid the viral load is very low and is cleared very quickly so the chance of spreading it is quite low. And the chance of getting it in the first place is very low. I expect as research continues, we will know the precise numbers. But there are real world examples of high vaccine rates results in low cases of transmission. But the locations that have been exposed to the new delta variant are reintroducing mask wearing because not enough of the population got vaccinated. So your choice is prolonging the pandemic as you are an easy target for the new variants. 

May I respectfully suggest you change your position from a hard pass to a soft pass while you do your own research on legitimate, peer reviewed websites or a respected medical profession. And this almost certainly does not include YouTube videos. A hard pass implies that no matter what new information you learn you still won't change your mind.

There's no reason to place blame on **anyone** who chooses not to vaccinate. **period.**

Don't take someone being an asshole on the internet, or a press agent's poor advice as a reason to blame anyone else for infections. If you want to protect your loved ones take covid seriously.

xxavierx,"I empathize with your frustration‚ÄîI really do. While it might look like in this moment your vaccination was vain, I assure you it wasn‚Äôt. Your vaccination, while not offering perfect protection, does still reduce your risk of contracting and spreading the virus which contributes to our lowered ICU and fatality  numbers. One day, this all will pass‚Äîall of it, the mask mandates, the passports (which similar to you, I don‚Äôt agree with though for slightly different reasons ‚Äî health data IMO should not be used to determine societal access)‚Ä¶but this will only pass because you and your spouse got vaccinated. So please, don‚Äôt regret that choice.

Children and vaccines‚ÄîI do, as controversial as it sounds, think it‚Äôs still up in the air with more data needed but I do think our government is actually doing right by putting it through the traditional vs accelerated process because the risk for kids is not the same as the risk for those much older. While I empathize with the wish to vaccinate them to curb spread, I don‚Äôt think we should be chasing spread as the be-all-end-all at the expense of risk/benefits to those getting vaccinated themselves. Given the UK has sided with not vaccinating them for the time being, I‚Äôm pragmatic that should we go that route it‚Äôs not likely to be the case we have the same threshold for them as we do for adults but having that option will give youth at risk and their families peace of mind.

Your risk as an individual

Your risk as a {insert gender/age/race here}

I got vaccinated so I'm much less likely to die of it, and so that if I did come into contact with someone who has it, I'm less likely to bring it home to the family.

My friend's in-laws both got covid. He was the healthier of the two, ended up on a ventilator. She only got tested because he was sick. Zero symptoms. I can't remember what their vaccination status was, they might have had their first shot - this was some time ago.

I agree that one of the problems is the lack of testing, and thus the artificially low case counts. If there had been 100,000 cases in Winnipeg over xmas and 100 people died, that's a completely different ""risk profile"" than 100 deaths from 10,000 cases. If I was Heather, I'd want the ""total number of cases"" to be as high as possible, to show that the risk of getting really sick/dying is extremely low, and making people feel better about opening up.

But to say they didn't have the power to do it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of basic civics and levels of government. 

&gt;What‚Äôs your take on all the major covid science points made having been debunked by the same scientists who created it? 

Considering you likely haven't taken a science class since grade school im exceedingly eager to hear what ""major covid science points"" (the fact you actually typed that out ü§£) have been *debunked* by the same scientists that made them. 

Side question, do you intentionally sound like a ben shapiro youtube title? Next you'll tell me how these science theories were **destroyed** by facts and logix!

&gt;Vaccines? proven as relatively Ineffective‚Ä¶

Really? Why is it you dumbasses always have to die on that hill? Like sure you wanna make the dumb agrument that mandates are fascism and masks are literally hitler, sure be a clown. But you want to argue against modern medicine too? Like dude, up until omicron covid cases were *overwhelmingly* in the unvaccinated, and deaths were almost exclusively unvaccinated. Even with omicron, ICUs and deaths were still mostly unvaccinated, despite barely being 10% of the population. 

You're genuinely a dumbass. 

&gt;Lockdowns? proven as ineffective‚Ä¶

My guy our hospital system can barely handle a flu season, let alone a flu season with covid mixed in. Lockdowns are the only thing that kept our hospitals and medical staff from literally imploding. This is something you people never consider because all you care about it yourself. You don't give a fuck about the nurses working 36h shifts and getting PTSD from covid wards. You don't care if nobody can get medical treatment because hospital beds are full of covid patients. No to you and the propaganda you devour, lockdowns did absolutely nothing and there was no sane reason behind them. Government officials just tanked their own economies for shits and giggles. 

&gt;That said, how can anybody continue to justify vaccine mandates

Not anymore no because times have changed. They were never meant to be permanent despite illiterate monkeys like you screaming this was the first step to concentration camps. Everything is being lifted now because covid is finally becoming endemic and enough of us did our part and got vaccinated so our hospitals aren't as burdened. This was expected to anybody with a brain. We had mandates through the worst of it and now that we're out of the woods they lift. Why is that such a difficult concept for people like you to grasp? 

Im curious, in the spring when the snow melts do you call everybody who had snow tires on a dumbass because ""how can you justify snow tires now when the science shows the snow has melted?"". Like would you intentionally ignore the past 5 months of winter like you're ignoring the past wave of covid that was the hardest yet, or do you just genuinely have the memory of a goldfish and not actually remember this past covid wave/winter?

aliveandkicking2020,"Just to avoid confusion. I am tripple vaxxed and I will vaxx myself as much as I need to. Obviously I am pro-vaccines and the restrictions don't bother me too much. I enjoy working from home for the last 2 years ;)

However.....

I don't see herd immunity as the way to stay immune to the virus.  Because I believe we will never become immune to the virus.  But we need to get a state where getting covid is like getting a flu.  And for most people that is fortunately the case today because they got vaccinated.   

So the question is how we are going to get to that stage or maybe stay at this stage. So it is either we keep on getting vaccinated but the question I have is if this is maintainable or people just getting tired of this.  So then the alternative is getting anti-bodies from getting sick. And that is the gamble the governments are taking with the added benefit they can say that everything is open. 

I am not saying I am in full support of this.  I like things to more open but I also like some protective measures since personally I expect another way next winter.  But in the end, nobody really knows.....",1645730156,hya216z,t3_szxe88,t1_hy90r2z,ontario,t5_2qsf3,NA

However, as part of the sane 90%, I can't imagine why a business would do any extra labour to enforce safety concerns.

The people who work there aren‚Äôt unique assholes for doing so- they are ready to move on and are being given the go ahead to do so. It will be a political decision by the government- but not a decision by most places who drop it at all.

As I recall his thought process was then ""Well, can I get someone else's, and what would it take?""  His theory was that he could get someone elses just by knowing their birthdate and the month they got vaccinated.  So he looked in some newspapers and found Jason Kenney's birthdate and the month he got immunized.  This was all publicly known since JK had talked about both.  So, he plugged in those values expecting to get Jason Kenney's record (a bit of a 'ha! got you' moment if it had worked).  

The problem is that he got someone ELSE's information.  A woman who as I recall had the same birthdate as Jason Kenney, and had been immunized the same month.  I suspect maybe she was just first alphabetically.  At that point I'm sure he said ""Shit..."".  He shut down the experiment and says that's the point where he contacted AHS.

""In no way did I say anything, ‚Äúanti-vax‚Äù in fact I actually said that I am vaccinated. I got vaccinated in hopes of a return to normalcy. I got vaccinated to reduce the threat of contracting and spreading the virus. And I also got vaccinated so that I would never have to wear a mask again.

I‚Äôve done my part since the beginning, to the best of my ability. We shut down our store for ten days when we had one positive case even though every other employee tested negative. For you to say I‚Äôm putting anyone at risk is absurd. We don‚Äôt come within six feet of any customer, and every single employee of mine is double vaccinated. Please tell me why we need to wear masks still?

If you‚Äôre going to say to protect those who can‚Äôt get the vaccine, well for one, we‚Äôre located in a bar, so there are no children coming into the store. 2, when I‚Äôm in public, I‚Äôm never near any children. Nor do I go near enough anyone to put my droplets into their mouth. 3, there are inherent risks to life. If those risks are too much for you, then you should stay home with your mask on. I‚Äôd rather live my life in the short time we have on earth. 

Furthermore, these cloth masks that everyone wears are completely nonsensical. It even says on the box, not meant to provide protection from viruses. The particle size of the virus is much smaller than the holes in the cloth mask.

Nothing I said I‚Äôm my comments was anti science. In fact, you pushing for masks so hard makes me think you might be the one whose anti-vax? If the vaccine was the solution, you wouldn‚Äôt feel the need to wear a mask? I‚Äôm fully vaccinated, so I don‚Äôt feel the need to cover my face. I‚Äôm just trying to get back to the world we once knew. If you want to wear your mask forever, that‚Äôs fine. I would never say judge or say anything negative to someone wearing a mask, because it is their choice. Just like they should respect my choice not to wear one. And I‚Äôm not even one of those jerks whose going to go into a store and berate people because I don‚Äôt want to wear a mask. Now that they‚Äôre mandatory, I‚Äôm wearing mine in stores again, and I‚Äôm always respectful to people‚Äôs personal space.

So thank you for your time, but I will not be looking on the Reddit page. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just a toxic place where people bash others to fill the void that‚Äôs missing in their own life.

Now we just have 30% of the population wearing their ignorance like a badge of honor. 

But I‚Äôm hoping all of that 30% isn‚Äôt that - some might be putting it off thinking it‚Äôs still as big of a pain in the ass to get as it was, some are just legitimately terrified of needles in general rather than what‚Äôs in them. Some are lazy or haven‚Äôt had this affect anyone they know personally so it couldn‚Äôt possibly affect them. Some only narcissistically see how it affects them and only how it affects them and they‚Äôll be fine, not the point of it which is to immunize the community to benefit everyone.

I‚Äôd bet that almost every single unvaccinated person in the hospital that‚Äôs catching it now since vaccines have been readily available thought *it won‚Äôt happen to me* or *my immune system is strong* or *I‚Äôm not in an at-risk group* because everyone else that could who thought the opposite got vaccinated. So that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre left with, covid being caught mostly by a bunch of people who all thought ‚Äúit‚Äôll never happen to me.‚Äù

Experimental! Emergency use!)‚Äî all because they‚Äôre afraid and have been made to feel afraid to get a vaccine. They can call it whatever they want and redefine words to mean whatever, but it‚Äôs so obviously and transparently Fear.

The most ironic part is that they‚Äôll call *other* people sheep while essentially copy-pasting somebody else‚Äôs words and thoughts that have been fed to them, repeated as if by rote, not one original point of their own thought, all interchangeably and predictably the same, and project some sort of ‚Äúok, then - continue to live in fear‚Äù mantra without realizing it‚Äôs so blindingly obvious to everyone else that they are so fearful of getting a vaccine that they‚Äôd potentially give up the ability to travel to other countries, or if things go as they are elsewhere, to eat in restaurants, go to events and concerts..  

What they project as us living in fear is that 70% of us are bored and restless at the finish line waiting for the 30% who are too scared to even start the race.

mattchew1993,"&gt;That's a terrible idea when vulnerable people are still part of the public. 

There will always be vulnerable people. I'm tired of pretending like the elderly are the most important people on earth. 

Young people gave up 2 years of their lives. Many gave up their savings because they either lost work, or their spouse lost work. Vacations were given up, experiences were given up, things they will never get back. All the while they watched their futures being sold and watched as housing became an out of reach goal during the pandemic. 

For what? To protect the elderly? The people who get to ride out the pandemic in their houses, while receiving their comfortable pensions. I realize not everyone has it easy, but a good chunk of elderly people got to ride out the pandemic in a much more comfortable setting than young people who are paying $1500/month for a dingy 2 bedroom.

I sympathize with people who want life to go back to normal. The early college years (main demographic of Bull &amp; Barrel) only get a few years to let loose and have fun before real life begins for them. 2 years doesn't sound like a lot but college is what, 3 years? When 2/3 of your college years are spent wearing masks and not getting the same experience as those before you, I can understand why masks come off and they just want to socialize and meet people. 

At what point do we put the responsibility for the elderly and immunocompromised to stay home and lock themselves down while everyone else goes back to normal? Yeah, COVID can still spread, but when young people are vaccinated they generally don't have a hard time with COVID. Of course they want to live their lives again. 

Put stricter measures on enforcement of not allowing unvaccinated into these businesses. We did what we were told, we got vaccinated - so what's next? We're just going to constantly do these cycles of restrictions indefinitely? We're going to be expected to wear masks indefinitely? Let people enjoy the few years of no responsibilities.

Gregnor,"Well bud you asked for the reasoning behind mandates against unvaxed vs the obese and I have answered.  You may not agree with the logic there but it is there never the less.  I don't agree with our current drug laws!   Still there...

To refer to your other points yeah sure any tax on the unvaxed would have legal hurdles because there is no precedent.  IMO it is still far more realistic than a yearly weigh station.  Then, for your high-risk activities point, that is called the [slippery slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slippery_slope) logic fallacy.  If we do anything about something then that means will things will slide out of control.  The world does not work that way...  This reminds me of the fears people had when the Emergencies Act was enacted.  Any day now the government is going to haul people out of their houses and vaccinate them!  Never happened did?  Even though right now the gov has the legal authority to do so.

As for your Vax paragraph, the expectations of what a vaccine should be able to do have been all over the place.  A vaccine that provides immunity for years is the gold standard best of the best.  Plenty do not reach that level, but do provide better outcomes for odds of infection, need for intervention, and prevention of transmission.  That it is not the best of the best is not a good excuse for not getting one.

Next, I want to take a second and talk about the Natural Immunity argument I have seen cropping up.  This has always been framed as Natural vs Vaxed and their relative numbers as an excuse to not be vaxed.  I would like to point out there is a third group that has both of them beat!  Someone who was vaxed and then caught covid...  There you have someone who when they were sick had far lower chances of hospitalizations and would have spread covid less.  Then, after their already prepared immune system beat covid, they now have both Natural and Vaxxed immunity!  After that you have people who caught covid then got vaxxed after.  Riskier, but still better than either the only vaxed or only Nat.",1644516478,hweawv6,t3_soyuv9,t1_hwcfbjb,britishcolumbia,t5_2qnc6,NA

People lost jobs, business, livelihood only to be told that actually, salons for example, these areas are of low transmission risk and don't even require a vax to enter.  What?!?  

A lot of people think that getting the vax will speed up the process to getting back to ""normal life"" which will never happen.  Oh, you've got both your shots but didn't get your booster, you're now ineligible to participate in society.  

Same government that's trying to push a use it or loose policy towards those who own large parcels of land as invest but continue to let foreign buyers consume our real estate as an investment and create a housing market that prices out 90% of our citizens.   

Didn't know we lived in a communist, but it makes sense after our PM has praised China's dictatorship regime.

Our government is failing us, dividing us and instead of scrutinizing them; we scrutinize each other.  Pointing our fingers at our neighbours for a situation cause by poor decision making and general incompetence.

BTW, I'm Vaxxed, and now with the availability of rapid tests, I test myself every time prior to leaving my isolated workplace ( I work 2 weeks in 2 weeks out) to prevent unknowingly spreading it to my girlfriend, her son, or the elderly people she works with. If I were to test positive, I'd stay in this isolated workplace, and my 2 room mates who work at the same place for a different, would have to isolate for 5 days as well. My friends who are double vaxxed, for the most part, don't test, or at least don't admit that they are, they think because they ""did the right thing"" and got vaxxed, they are now immune to it. 

I'm not personally worried about getting covid, almost everyone I work with has gotten it, some multiple times, one guy, 3 times. He's double vaxxed and 1x boosted. Maybe he's just unlucky, maybe he puts too much faith in his vaccines and let's his haurd down. Maybe some people are more prone to it than others. Maybe some people are much less prone to it than others? I only got vaxxed because It was get vaxxed, or lose a $700/ day after tax job, and I only did it after it became a requirement in November. No one I work with who has gotten it has said it's any worse than a bad cold or flu, some people didn't even know they had it until they tested for it only after another close contact coworker tested positive.

The site is analyzing the comorbidities of pandemic, it is published 2020/11/16 so it doesn't include data on the current situation / Delta.

sarahkbabi,"Not my words but:

Over the last ten months or so, the government of Canada (provincial and federal) stated on the daily that ‚Äòonce Canada reached a 75 percent rate of double vaccination, we would reach the necessary rate of herd immunity which would lift the lockdowns and see life return to normal.‚Äô 

Millions and millions of dollars were spent on massive gov marketing campaigns calling Canadians to ‚Äòdo their part, and get vaccinated‚Äô so that we could return to normal. Daily updates on CP24, open displays of Trudeau and Ford taking the shot to encourage others, posters/billboards, commercials, etc. we all saw them. In fact, I would say based on my exp most people that I know got the vaccine not necessarily because they were personally afraid of or personally at risk from the respiratory illness, but because they saw it as their moral duty as a citizen to contribute in reaching the 75 percent herd immunity goal. By getting the shots, it brought us one step closer to life as normal. Or, they got the shots because they were tired of Covid, stressed out from the lockdowns, and were being told that this was the way forward to a return to normalcy. We waited patiently, enduring the stress and pain of lockdowns, children missing school, kids missing sports, people losing their jobs permanently, and worse, because the gov assured Canadians that once we hit 75, things will open up. 

About ten days ago, the Ontario chief medical doctor Kieran Moore said we were close to the 75 and would therefore be lifting lockdowns. And then, two days ago, it happened. According to the Toronto Star, we reached the herd immunity rates. 81 percent of Canadians over 12 got their first dose, and 74.2 percent had/have their second. We did our part, so to speak, and did what the government required. 

However, two days ago in the afternoon, Dr. Kieran Moore went on live TV and said the following. After congratulating Canadians on reaching the milestone of 75 percent herd immunity, he stated that the lockdowns will not be lifted (‚Äúput on pause‚Äù as he said,), citizens, starting with the most vulnerable, would be needing a third ‚Äòbooster‚Äô shot (something we were not told about at all and people who warned that booster shots would be needed were called ‚Äòconspiracy theorists,‚Äô whatever that means), and then, to finish his presentation, he said, and I quote, ‚ÄúI am sorry to say, but it is going to be a difficult fall and winter.‚Äù

Now, the first and immediate question is, now that we have reached the 75% number for herd immunity, why are we not opening up? 

In fact, it seems it is the complete opposite, with more (and harsher) lockdowns on the horizon. As Dr. Moore said, it is going to be ‚Äòa difficult fall and winter.‚Äô Who knows what that means. And this raises questions and concerns about the entire narrative of the last ten months, and the nature/efficacy of the vaccine itself. 

If the vaccines are efficient and effective in the fight against the illness, why are we not opening up now that we reached our target of 75 percent herd immunity for which we patiently waited for and suffered for? If 75 percent vaccination was not the goal, then why was it ever stated as such to begin with?

Or, on the opposite end, if the vaccines are not as efficient as they were promised, as in people can still get Covid, spread Covid, and get sick from Covid, why are they being required on mass? One could go even further based on what Trudeau said yesterday, that ‚Äúeveryone who does not have a legitimate medical reason for getting vaccinated will face serious consequences.‚Äù The vaccine passport will effectively cause millions of Canadians to lose their jobs if they don‚Äôt take the shots, lose access to social events which are good for mental health, restaurants, cannot travel, and more. In fact, statistically, Covid cases are 550% higher now than the exact same time last year (Aug 15 2020 was 106 new cases, avg weekly 85, August 15 2021 was 526 new cases, weekly average of 409). 

So, if the vaccine is not nearly as effective in stopping Covid as promised, why mandate and require it under severe threat of penalty? Really, why were vaccines promised as the solution to the problem that would lead us back to normalcy if they never could fix the problem in the first place?

Now, so far, the response has usually been something like the following: ‚ÄúNo PJ (you idiot), the vaccine was never meant to cure Covid, stop people from getting Covid or spreading it. The vaccine was only meant to minimize the risk of spread and minimize the effects of the symptoms. In fact, like most vaccines (the common flu vaccine for example), viruses evolve and mutate (like the Delta variant) which makes the current dose of vaccination susceptible to failure, or a reduced effectiveness. It is a straw man to state that the vaccines were meant to alleviate us from lockdowns and return us to normal, because you do not understand how herd immunity and vaccines work. They were never meant to stop the spread or stop the illness.‚Äù

Ok, fine. Thinking aloud here, I can grant that. But for someone to admit and stand on that argument it immediately means a few things. It means right away that the entire narrative and promise of the government over the last ten months that once we reached 75 percent we would return to normal was not true. We put our trust and belief in that narrative, getting the shots under the condition vaccinations would lead to a return to normal, only to reach that goal and find the goal posts moved again. If the shots were never meant to lead us back to normalcy, then the gov needs to answer to some serious questions about what was the purpose of the lockdowns over the last ten months or so that Canadians endured while we waited to reach herd immunity?

And that makes one question the nature of the vaccines themselves. If the gov knew that the shots would not stop the spread of Covid, why did they ever tell us that 75 percent would be herd immunity and thus the reason to return to normal? How did they reach the number of 75 percent if they knew the vaccines were effective? 

And now, by forcing the entire population to get vaccinated under threat of extremely severe consequences, it still seems likely that lockdowns are going to be imminent once more, the very thing we were told would not happen if we got to 75. As Dr. Moore said, we are in for a difficult fall and winter (I take that as code for more lockdowns but who knows what 'difficult' means.)

Or, perhaps the gov did not know months back that the vaccine would not prevent the nation from returning to lockdowns. Maybe they were rather estimating and hoping that the vaccine would be effective, that there would not be variants, that maybe 75 percent would be good enough. Perhaps they made an honest and hopeful assumption that 75 percent double vax rates would be good enough. But if that is the case, the nature of the vaccine always was and simply is experimental. There is no other way around that. The rising case counts, the threat of impending lockdowns, and the shifting of goalposts yet again is the very proof that the vaccines were experimental and non-effective. Because logically, if they were effective we would not be returning to lockdowns and things would be fully open and back to normal now. 

The issue of the vaccine being experimental is the very reason why so many people have been hesitant to take it. But if it is not experimental, and established ""science"" (Science= the most political and useful word used by anyone to win arguments), then why are we changing goalposts once again? Why are we not re-opening if we reached the 75 percent? If we knew the vaccines were effective, then we not open up? If we didn‚Äôt know they would be effective, and susceptible to being ineffective towards new, mutating variants, why are we requiring them under such extreme threats like a vaccine passport? And, if reaching targeted vaccine rates was not the solution to ending lockdowns and returning to normal, what is? There seems to be no end to perpetual lockdowns in sight, which is not good at all. The lockdowns are extremely harmful and stressful for and on everyone (well, except for Amazon and Wal-Mart I guess). Is the goal of the government perpetual and constant lockdowns, for who knows how many years to come?",1629390455,h9jt7wc,t3_p7gutd,t3_p7gutd,ontario,t5_2qsf3,NA

I have two members of my family with cancer and two elderly grandparents who I'm 1000% more scared of getting COVID than getting it myself.,1644865663,hwxxcmz,t3_sscd8c,t1_hwxpk41,ontario,t5_2qsf3,NA
akaliant,"Are you new to the pandemic? The reason for getting vaxxed is about protecting others as much as it is about protecting yourself. Same goes with taking precautions to prevent spread. 

Kids are even less likely to get seriously sick than 19-22 year olds, but health experts are rushing to approve the vaccine so they can get it as well. The reason is any spread is bad, and increases the chance of a break-through infection in someone vaccinated, or an full-blown infection in someone not vaccinated.

You only have to look at Alberta and NB to see this play out. Their outbreaks were  driven in part by young people who were not very concerned about getting it themselves, who in turn helped spread it, which has resulted in record hospitalizations and deaths in both provinces.",1632650790,hebvrlt,t3_pvh83a,t1_heajsfv,halifax,t5_2r77k,NA
Getzsarah,Thank you! My number one reason for getting vaxxed was to help protect those who can‚Äôt (the under 12 crew) so I truly appreciate those that are willing to change their minds.,1630257717,hatqda4,t3_pdlzw0,t3_pdlzw0,saskatchewan,t5_2r4dl,NA
